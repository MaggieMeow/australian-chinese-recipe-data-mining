Chop Suey,10,10,233203020,https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-501748968,CHINESE COOKING (3 July 1946),Article; Article/Journal or magazine article,1946,Article,Australian; Australia--Social life and customs--Periodicals.; Women--Australia--Periodicals.,OLA YOUNG,The Australian woman's mirror.,"CHINESE COOKING Chop Suey is a Europeanised version of Chinese food and is interesting and easy to cook. It is seldom seen outside Chinese homes and restaurants, because Chinese do not willingly pass on recipes. During extensive research into Chinese cooking overt a long period of years in three States I have come across only one Chinese cook-book, and this was so obviously a fake and its recipes so incorrect rect that I could not imagine anyone could be taken in by it. All the recipes given here, all that I know of Chinese food, I have learned by the taste - and - see, the trial - and - error method. I suppose my research has cost me a good deal, but has certainly given me many fine meals. My chop suey cooking may not be altogether correct in every detail, but it has been eaten and enjoyed by at least one Chinese, who remarked with a smile that my sweet-sour dishes were as “good as Mother made.” The origin of chop suey is obscured in countless stories, each claiming to be true. Though I do not really believe either, here are two I like. The first says that in Alaska during the gold-rush all the European pean cafes ran out of food and the miners were compelled to go to the Chinese cafe. The Chinese too had run out of food, but they had some rice and lots of little odds and ends, and these they mixed, calling the dish Chop Suey (reputed to mean in Chinese, odds and ends; little bits). The miners liked the food and from then on the cafe was well patronised, but patrons would not eat the regular Chinese dishes and insisted on calling for Chop Suey. According to the other story Chop Suey originated in New York. An American was invited to a Chinese banquet; he did not behave well, but pestered the Chinese diplomat who sat beside him to tell him what each dish contained. By the time the dish we call Chop Suey came along the diplomat was much out of temper, and in answer to the question replied “Oh, Chop Suey” (little bits). The other Chinese present were so amused that ever since the dish has been called Chop Suey. Whether or not the yarns have any truth in them, the dish itself is now popular everywhere. The basis of good Chop Suey cooking is rice. Chinese eat rice with everything, and much of their food is so rich that.it would be impossible to eat it without. In serving Chop Suey in the home I always set a bowl for each person; after the soup is eaten from it rice is placed in the bowl and the food placed on the rice. In cooking the rice, a saucepan with a well-fitting lid is necessary. I use half as much water again as I use rice; for instance, i cup of rice to ij cup of water. Bring to the boil, then place on the back of the stove, or turn down the flame as low as possible and cook very slowly until all the water evaporates; the rice is then quite dry and every grain separate. Long Soup and Short Soup are the two best-known Chinese soups. They are easily prepared. From the stock in which a chicken has been boiled, clear every particle of fat or flesh until the clear liquid is left, drop into it long or short noodles, and just as it goes to the table garnish it with finely shredded greens of shallots or Spring onions. *To Make Noodles: Beat 1 large egg lightly with J teaspon salt, add 3 cup flour (enough to make stiff dough) and knead well till smooth. Roll out on floured board till very . th .’ n A I( r ave on board until dry, but not too brittle to handle. Long Noodles: Fold dough into a tight roll like a Swiss roll and cut with a sharp knife into ribbons or thin threads. Toss the strips lightly with the fingers to separate them, spread out on board to dry thoroughly and store in covered jar. Drop into the boiling soup 10 minutes before it is to be served. . Short Noodles: Fold dough into roll, but cut in .inch-wide strips. When required, cut strips into squares, put in the centre of each a piece of chicken mincemeat and fold. In a Chinese cafe of any size one man is kept continually busy making noodles, for they are used in many other dishes besides soups. The noodle-maker moulds a great mass of sifted flour and breaks the eggs into the centre. Over the table, set into the wall on a hinge, is fixed a bamboo pole; by working this backwards and forwards the dough is made. More pressure is applied when the noodle-maker sits on the end of the pole and jiggles up and down as he rolls out the dough. After the soup any of the following dishes can be served. The usual method is to place the dish on the table, when each person helps himself from the plate and piles the food on the rice already in his bowl. I have given’English names to the dishes, for in no two cafes are they the same. Sometimes Chicken Chow Mien is called Chicken Chop Suey and vice versa, and both may vary greatly in each cafe. Sweet-sour Pork.— Cut into 1-inch cubes some pieces of fat pork, roll in egg and then in biscuit-crumbs and deep fry in oil. Cut into chunks some cauliflower, celery, onion, beans Chinese cabbage, a slice of pineapple, 2 of 3 pieces of ginger (enough in all to fill a large dinner plate). Fry quickly in a dessertspoon of very hot oil, turning all the time for 2 minutes; add to the pork, put on large servingdish dish and pour the sweet-sour sauce over. To make the Sauce: Put in a pan 1 level tablespoon brown sugar, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 tablespoon finely-chopped pineapple, a dash of soy sauce, h teaspoon ginger syrup. Cook all together. Just before taking from pan thicken with cornflour. Take from stove, add 1 tablespoon chopped green shallot, pour sauce over vegetables and pork and serve with rice. Sweet and Sour Fish is made in the same way, using fish instead of pork. Any vegetable can be substituted for those mentioned, but all, including onions, must be cut in £in. cubes. Chicken Chop Suey. —Cut cooked chicken or fowl into 1-inch cubes. Dice vegetables similar to those used for sweet-sour dishes. Mushrooms and carrots are frequently used. Put all ingredients in very hot fat and pour over them 1 teaspoon of soy sauce. Lift out (Continued on page 46.) vegetables, add a little water to the oil and liquid in the pan, thicken with cornflour and serve with rice. Prawns can replace chicken. The Chinese remove the skin from the prawn in all places bat the tail. When put in hot oil the prawn curls around the unskinned red tail and looks most attractive. Chicken Chow Mien is different from Chop Suey in that the vegetables _ and chicken are served on a bed of fried noodles, the long variety. Boil the noodles 10 minutes, then pop them into a pan of boiling oil. Drain and serve under the chicken and vegetable. Chinese Oyster Omelet. —Use 1 bottle of oysters. Shred a handful of cabbage (Chinese or otherwise), cube a large onion, cut beans into lengths and mix vegetables with 1 teaspoon spoon soy sauce. Use enough vegetables to cover a small plate, less if desired, and cook in hot oil for 2 minutes. Beat 4 eggs very lightly, add i cup cold water and pour into pan. When the bottom has set slightly add vegetables and oysters and place under grill. Serve with rice. Omelets can be made with prawns, chicken, mushrooms and veges in any mixture ture if liked. So long as the soy sauce is added and the pan smeared with oil the taste is definitely Chinese. OLA YOUNG.

spring rolls,13,13,236501132,https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-1342105745,SOME SECRETS OF CHINESE COOKING (31 December 1948),Article; Article/Journal or magazine article,1948,Article,Australian Broadcasting Commission--Periodicals.; Radio programs--Australia--Periodicals.; Television programs--Australia--Periodicals.,Australian Broadcasting Commission; By Madame CHAU,ABC weekly,"SOME SECRETS OF CHINESE COOKING By Madame CHAU ALL my Australian friends simply adore Chinese food. I always ask them these two questions. First, why do you like our food? Their answer, because it is so tasty and because cause there is such a variety of dishes. Second, what dishes do you like best? Their answer, fried rice, chicken chow mien, sweet and sour pork, chicken and almonds and spring rolls. The most undeveloped branch of Western cooking is that of preparing vegetables. For example, spinach— enemy No. 1 of all children—is never cooked properly. It should be fried in a hot pan with oil and salt and taken away before it loses its crispness. Lettuce tuce prepared in the same manner is also delightful. In the West, there is a large number of foods which have not even been experimented upon. Fried chicken gizzard along with fried chicken liver dipped in rock salt is among the commonest dishes in China. Carp’s head with its delicate flesh around the cheeks and jowl is served as a special dish of great delicacy. By combinations and permutations five or six ingredients, like dried shrimp, mushroom, bamboo shoot, melon, pork, etc-, can give a hundred varieties of different soups. Dried scallops are one of the most Important elements for making good soup, and so is awabi. A rich turtle soup, cooked until it is sticky on the lips, is one of the favourite dishes sometimes being prepared pared with the webbed feet of ducks or geese. • p'RESHNESS, flavour, and texture are the three essentials. The best cook in the world cannot make a savoury dish unless he has fresh things to cook with, and any good cook can tell you that half the art of cooking lies in buying. The texture of food, as regards tenderness, elasticity, crispness, and softness, is largely a matter of timing and adjusting the heat of the fire. As for flavour, there are two Glasses of food— those that are best served in their own juice without out adulteration except salt or soyabean sauce and those that taste best when they are combined with the flavour of another food. Thus bamboo shoot and pork seem to make a perfect pair, each borrowing its fragrance from the other and lending ing it in return its own. Ham somehow combines well with the sweet flavour, and one of the best dishes is ham with rich golden dates, steamed together in a casserole. And there is a large class of food most valued by the Chinese which have no flavour of their own—shark’s fin, bird’s nest and the silver fungus depend entirely on borrowing from others. The reason why they taste so wonderful is because they are always prepared in the most expensive soup possible. YOU’D like to know how to make spring rolls. Well, I’m indebted to Mr. Lee for the following recipe: Ingredients: lib. minced pork or beef or prams, lib. onions, celery, or spring onions, 1 tablespoonful ful of soyabean sauce, salt and pepper, lib lard or oil, lib. plain flour. Cut the vegetables into fine strips. Pry in a small amount of oil or lard for three minutes, then add the minced meat and fry together quickly for another five minutes. During the process of frying, ing, pour in the soyabean sauce and add a pinch pf salt. Leave the cooked meat and vegetables in a cool place for at least half an hour. Make a mixture with Jib of flour and threequarters quarters of a pint of water. Heat a small fryingpan. pan. On a very low heat, grease its surface evenly with a piece of oil-soaked cotton and pour a tablespoonful spoonful of the flour mixture into the frying-pan.

","SOME SECRETS OF CHINESE COOKING By Madame CHAU ALL my Australian friends simply adore Chinese food. I always ask them these two questions. First, why do you like our food? Their answer, because it is so tasty and because cause there is such a variety of dishes. Second, what dishes do you like best? Their answer, fried rice, chicken chow mien, sweet and sour pork, chicken and almonds and spring rolls. The most undeveloped branch of Western cooking is that of preparing vegetables. For example, spinach— enemy No. 1 of all children—is never cooked properly. It should be fried in a hot pan with oil and salt and taken away before it loses its crispness. Lettuce tuce prepared in the same manner is also delightful. In the West, there is a large number of foods which have not even been experimented upon. Fried chicken gizzard along with fried chicken liver dipped in rock salt is among the commonest dishes in China. Carp’s head with its delicate flesh around the cheeks and jowl is served as a special dish of great delicacy. By combinations and permutations five or six ingredients, like dried shrimp, mushroom, bamboo shoot, melon, pork, etc-, can give a hundred varieties of different soups. Dried scallops are one of the most Important elements for making good soup, and so is awabi. A rich turtle soup, cooked until it is sticky on the lips, is one of the favourite dishes sometimes being prepared pared with the webbed feet of ducks or geese. • p'RESHNESS, flavour, and texture are the three essentials. The best cook in the world cannot make a savoury dish unless he has fresh things to cook with, and any good cook can tell you that half the art of cooking lies in buying. The texture of food, as regards tenderness, elasticity, crispness, and softness, is largely a matter of timing and adjusting the heat of the fire. As for flavour, there are two Glasses of food— those that are best served in their own juice without out adulteration except salt or soyabean sauce and those that taste best when they are combined with the flavour of another food. Thus bamboo shoot and pork seem to make a perfect pair, each borrowing its fragrance from the other and lending ing it in return its own. Ham somehow combines well with the sweet flavour, and one of the best dishes is ham with rich golden dates, steamed together in a casserole. And there is a large class of food most valued by the Chinese which have no flavour of their own—shark’s fin, bird’s nest and the silver fungus depend entirely on borrowing from others. The reason why they taste so wonderful is because they are always prepared in the most expensive soup possible. YOU’D like to know how to make spring rolls. Well, I’m indebted to Mr. Lee for the following recipe: Ingredients: lib. minced pork or beef or prams, lib. onions, celery, or spring onions, 1 tablespoonful ful of soyabean sauce, salt and pepper, lib lard or oil, lib. plain flour. Cut the vegetables into fine strips. Pry in a small amount of oil or lard for three minutes, then add the minced meat and fry together quickly for another five minutes. During the process of frying, ing, pour in the soyabean sauce and add a pinch pf salt. Leave the cooked meat and vegetables in a cool place for at least half an hour. Make a mixture with Jib of flour and threequarters quarters of a pint of water. Heat a small fryingpan. pan. On a very low heat, grease its surface evenly with a piece of oil-soaked cotton and pour a tablespoonful spoonful of the flour mixture into the frying-pan. Let it run evenly over the whole pan until dry, then turn it out on to a flat plate. Repeat the same process for the number of pastry rounds required. Heap the cooked meat and vegetables oblong-wise in the centre of the pastry, fold up both ends first, then the sides. Close the edges with a little water. After having “hade all the rolls, fry them in lib. hot lard or oil, three or four at a time, until they turn brown. "

Stained Blanket “Harvey”: “Omega,” who has a blanket stained with verdigris 1 W.M. 17/3/’36), can remove the stains by bleaching with peroxide of hydrogen. Wet the stains thoroughly, then allow to dry, and when all stains have disappeared wash the blanket thoroughly, as the peroxide if allowed to remain in the blanket will rot the fabric. ""Baccye” : Make a solution of vinegar and salt (two parts vinegar to one part salt), apply generously to the stains and rub constantly for a few minutes, then wash blanket in warm soapy water. Finally put through a rinse of lukewarm water and peroxide (a dessertspoon of peroxide to a gallon of warm water). “Flying Fox” : Boil \ cup rice in 1 quart of water for J hour. Set aside for 12 hours and then strain through a cloth. Soak the stains in this for two or three hours, rinsing finally in clear water. Another good solution is one part of oxalic acid to six of water. Soak the stains, rinse icell and hang the blanket out in the sun. “Bijoev”: Make a paste of block magnesia and petrol, rub the affected parts and roll up until dry, then wash in warm soap-flakes and hang out on a dewy night. Besides removing stains this freshens the blanket greatly. “Running Late” : I would suggest dyeing the blanket. Either apple-gi’een or a fairly deep shade of blue would render the stain invisible. When a pair of blankets were stained with red dye off a book cover I dyed them a pretty rose pink. Bound at the ends with a matching band of satin ribbon the blankets looked new and smart. It is quite easy to do the work if the directions accompanying any reputable brand of dye are followed faithfully. Sliipts in the Sink “Yorks”; If “Flatite” (W.M. 17/3/’36) puts a fair-sized piece of salt near the outlet of the sink, where the salt will slowly dissolve and gradually seep down the sink-pipe, it should stop the slugs coming up and help to keep the pipe clean. Last thing at night wipe the sink dry and lay an inch-wide ring of salt round the outlet; salt is death to slugs. I have used this method with success. “Marion” : Dissolve 12oz. of alum in boiling water and mix it with | of a kero-tin of lime. Thin this solution down with water (about half and half) and pour it down the outletpipe pipe at night when the pests begin to appear; The slugs will be congregated near the outlet then. Pour a little down the overflow-pipe at same time, as the slugs sometimes shelter between it and the drain-pipe. The lime kills the live ones and the alum “gets” their eggs. “Hande” : If ""Flatite” flushes the sink with kerosene she will find that effective. Most pests dislike kerosene. Uneven Oven “Stoker” : From personal experience, perience, I advise “Mirror Reader” (W.M. 17/3/’36), who is having trouble with her spirit-stove oven, to place it in a different position and put round it a shield made from a sheet of corrugated iron or asbestos. I had the same trouble when camping recently, an unsuspected draught preventing ing the heat being equally distributed. buted. I also took the added precaution of covering everything I cooked. When cooking a sandwich, wich, I covered it with another sandwich-tin of the same size, and scones with an inverted tin baking-dish, ensuring even rising and browning. I had no further trouble or spoilt food. “Beralc” : To me it seems that “Mirror Reader” has her flame too high under the oven wh.cn cooking scones, cakes, etc. The solid slide should be above the cakes to throw the heat back on to the top of the cakes, etc. Have the oven quite hot when the cakes are ready to go in, then lower the flame under the oven while they are cooking, putting the shelf as high as possible. A further help would be to stand the cakes on an oven-tray containing sand or coarse salt. Instead of greasing the tins, especially with sponges, cut out rounds of paper to fit the tins, putting two or even three layers on the bottom of the tin. Experience will show which method suits the different articles cooked. “Bozo” : Put the cakes or scones as high as possible, but be sure to place them on an asbestos mat. This prevents the under-part being burnt. Also put an enamel or tin dish in the bottom of the oven filled with water and the steam prevents burning and hardening of cakes, etc. Coconut Balls “Freddy” : Tell “Freda,” who asked how to make coconut balls (W.M. 17/3/’36), that she needs a recipe for the centres and another for the cream for dipping. For the Centres: One pound of sugar, 3oz. glucose, 4oz. fine coconut, i pint water, pink coloring. Put sugar, glucose and water in a saucepan and dissolve, stirring with wooden spoon over slow heat. Dip a small brush in cold water and brush round sides of pan (without touching syrup) to remove any crystals that may have formed. When dissolved and clear, increase heat and boil rapidly to soft-ball stage (240 degrees). Removei let bubbles cease, pour batch into 2 basins ""and leave to stand till nearly cold. Beat up quickly, adding half of the coconut to each and pink coloring to one. Form into balls and leave on wax paper to harden, turning ing occasionally to dry underneath. A beginner will find it easier to fork the mixture out into small heaps on slab or flat plate, and form it into balls afterwards. This quantity is sufficient for trial purposes. The balls are afterwards dipped in melted Fondant Cream: One pound of sugar, J pint water; stir over moderate heat till dissolved. Brush the sides of the pan with cold water to dissolve any crystals that may form (avoid touching syrup). At boiling point add a good pinch of cream of tartar, put lid on, steam a few minutes. Remove lid and boil quickly to 242 degrees— a little higher than soft-hall stage. Remove, leave till bubbles have ceased and pour out on slab, previously sprinkled with cold water. When lukewarm, using a spatula, fold outside edges to centre and keep on folding inwards till syrup gets cloudy, then turn, beat and cream evenly all over till it becomes a hard white lump. Cover with a damp cloth for half an hour to “prove” the fondant, which can then be kneaded with the hands till soft and creamy. Divide the lump, leaving half white and coloring remainder pink. Wrap in wax paper, keep in airtight jar till wanted. For dipping, place a piece in a small basin and stand in pan of hot water till fondant melts. Using a cake-fork, dip the balls in. drain, and place on wax paper to harden. If fondant is too thick add a few drops of water. ","HELP!

After exhaustive inquiries and innumerable requests, I have at last been given the recipe by a Chinese chef. Most fruits lend themselves to this form of preserving, but carrots, limes, cucumber, pine-apple, pie-melon and hard rock-melons form the chief ingredients—although in the Chinese jar may be found tender bamboo shoots and Chinese nuts. Get a piece of green ginger-root, scrape it clean and cut into small dice. Cut an unpeeled cucumber into iin. slices, and then into dice. Scrape carrots and cut them into slices, adding a few young carrots too small to be cut up. The melon must be peeled and cut into pieces, and variety may be added by making the shapes of the cut fruit different according to the fruit; some diced, some in long strips, some in slices and (where melon may be wastefully used) some shaped into balls. Into a 2-quart basin of cold water put 1 teaspoon powdered alum, and into this throw the melon. Cut the pine-apple, after peeling and coring, into lin. pieces and place the pieces, with the carrots, ginger, small cumquats and any other fruits, into a basin of cold water.

Simmer for a while until the fruits are rather tender—a matter of 20 minutes or so. The simmering must be gentle, so that the fruits may not become mashed—they must retain their original shapes.

This second syrup is brought to the boil, boiled for 10 minutes, then strained, returned to the saucepan and again brought to the boil. The juice of a good lemon or a ripe lime is added, and when the syrup is boiling the drained fruits are dropped in. Simmer the conserve for a couple of hours very gently till each piece is clear and delicately cooked. When being bottled, care should be taken that each bottle contains an assortment —some carrot, some melon, a few pieces of ginger, a tiny cumquat, and so on.

Dim sims ,61,61,233168002,https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-428272511,To the Rescue (3 April 1934),Article; Article/Journal or magazine article,1934,Article,Australian; Australia--Social life and customs--Periodicals.; Women--Australia--Periodicals.,,The Australian woman's mirror.,"To the Rescue Soundproof Walls “City-Wed” : My husband, a fibrous-plaster worker, advises “ Woman Carpenter ” ( W. M. 13/3/’34) to buy soundproof fibrous-plaster sheets, which are stocked by all fibrous-plaster factories. There are several makes on sale at retail shops. If, however, ever, “ Woman Carpenter ” has already bought the ordinary flbro sheets she can make the wall soundproof by tacking flooring-felt, such as is used under linoleum, to the battens of framework before fore nailing the outer sheets into position. The wall will thus be lined with felt. “Dormab"" : Having erected the frame for the dividing wall, nail the iibro sheets to one side of the partition. On the opposite side tack hessian across the studs to a height of Bft. and fill the cavity thus made with sawdust, charcoal or buzzer-chips i from a planing-machine), and then nail on flbro sheets to complete the wall. There will be an unfilled cavity of 2ft. between the padded wall and the ceiling of 10ft. high, but it is obviously impossible to fill the wall completely, and it will be quite soundproof. It would be possible to fill the cavity between the sheets of fibro with sawdust as each sheet is put up, without using the hessian support, but it would be more tedious. “Try Me”: Newspapers tightly wedged between tween the two walls will make them soundproof, proof, and the tighter the paper is rammed in the less risk of fire. I know a block of offices where this method was used and there have been no complaints. Whichever medium is selected, “Woman Carpenter” should first ask her insurance company if it will affect the policy. ' “Jimmy” : The chemically treated and dried seaweed sold under various names for insulation tion packing is the least expensive, is clean, easily handled and is recommended by Alex Smith in his Home Carpentry. However, I believe lieve insurance companies prohibit packing of any kind in hollow walls. Dlm-sims “Sometime” ; It has taken some time, but I have just got from a Chinese cook the recipe for Dim-sims wanted by “Curious” (W.M. 12/12/’B3) : Mix 11b. rice-flour to a firm paste with boiling water, roll out as thinly as possible sible and wipe the surface over with a little hot peanut oil. Cut paste into (approx.) 36 square pieces. Chop up finely |lb. fat pork, £lb. shrimps, 2oz, chestnuts and_ 2oz. Chinese mushrooms (weighed before soaking). Mix all these ingredients together, put a little of the mixture on each square of paste, fold in triangular angular shape and press the edges together (when made in the shape of old-fashioned money-bags they are called Gow-gees). Place in one layer only in each basin, and steam. (Chinese mushrooms are dried and may be bought at Chinese provision shops.) Keeping Green Leaves “Sealeaf” ; Tell “Grove” (W.M. 13/3/’34) to lay fresh green leaves on a table and wipe each separately with a soft cloth which has been dipped in a solution of warm water strongly scented with eucalyptus oil. When dry press between the leaves of a book, place a weight on and put in a dark air-tight cupboard. Leaves treated in this way will retain their color for years. “Hey” : Boil 41b. powdered size or glue in 1 pint water till dissolved. solved. Leave till cool, then dip each leaf into the glue separately and spread them out to dry. Press them, then re-dip, dry press again, using a cold and heavy iron we /fbt to do so. ... “C.H. : This is how we preserved beechleaves leaves in England; the method is worth trying for other foliage. Pick the leaves while they are fresh and green and stand the stalks for 34 hours in a strong solution of salt and water, Then remove them and stand them in a halfand-half and-half mixture of glycerine and water. Let them remain until they cease to absorb any further moisture; they will then gradually change from green to golden brown and develop a rich and glossy appearance, while retaining their natural shape. ‘‘Jane’ : This is an old English recipe: Pick ZS pIM « pap-J, -J, mnicturp hoo pvnnnrDtprl Thp an irk dr -in- keens the leaves frorn fadin'odrying drying keeps the leaves from lading. Treacle Peanut Drops “Pop” : This is my recipe for treacle peanut toffee (“Sweetie,” W.M. 18/3/’34) ; Put 21b. each of treacle and brown sugar into a pan with 2 heaped tablespoons butter, allow to melt slowly, then boil up the toffee, stirring it all the time, and continue stirring till it becomes brittle when a spoonful is dropped into cold water. Add a little vanilla flavoring, pour the whole into an oiled tin, mark into squares and p ress a roasted peanut into each square. When cold break each square off and wrap in waxed paper. “Wei”: Put into a pan lib. brown sugar, 2oz. butter, 41b. black treacle, 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Bring slowly to the boil, and boil steadily for 25 minutes, Have the peanuts all shelled and prepared, then with a darning-needle dip each peanut in the toffee and set aside on a greased slide to cool, When cold wrap singly in waxed paper. The toffee left over makes excellent eating plain if packed in an air-tight tin. “Elwood” ; One cup of treacle, 1 cup each of white and brown sugar, 2 cups grated chocolate late and 1 cup milk or cream into which has been stirred 1 dessertspoon ground rice. Rub chocolate to a paste with a little of the milk or cream, mix entire ingredients together and boil i hour, taking care it doesn’t burn. Pour into-a buttered dish, and when cool enough to handle break off small pieces, place a roasted peanut in each piece, roll into tiny balls and wrap in waxed paper. “Rothy” ; Cook over a slow fire 2 cups granulated lated sugar, i cup cold water and J cup treacle till a drop of the syrup crackles in cold water. Add 1 tablespoon butter and i teaspoon vanilla essence. Beat 2 egg-whites to a stiff froth, then pour mixture over them, beating all the time, and beat briskly for a few minutes. Pour into small greased tin rings and place a peanut in the centre of each. Remove in 15 minutes and roll up. Cumquat Recipes “Jane” : “C-F.,” who wants cumquat recipes (W.M. 13/3/’34), will like these: Cumquat Conserve: Pick 6 doz. cpmquats with the stems on and leave for 3 days, till the stems will rub off without leaving a hole (which would allow the salt water to enter and spoil the conserve). Put cumquats in preserving-pan and just cover with cold water with 1 cup of salt added ; boil gently for | hour and strain off the water. Put on again in hoiliny water and 1 teaspoon of bicarb, soda, boil 20 minutes and strain water off once more. Now prick the fruit all over with a fork and then weigh. Make a syrup of 11b. sugar and 1 cup water to every pound of fruit and boil 3 hours or till syrup is very thick. Put while hot into wide-necked jars and put on lids or cover with tissue-paper soaked in hot milk. Cumquat Jelly: Soak cumquats for 24 hours in salt and water (about 1 cup salt to 1 gallon water). Pour off the water and cut the cumquats into quarters or thick slices and add 1 Lisbon lemon (cut up) to every dozen cumquats. Put fruit in preserving-pan with enough water to float it and boil for 2 hours or till quite tender. Strain without squeezing through a flannel jelly-bag and then add 1 cup sugar to 1 cup juice and boil for about i hour, or until it jells. Do not stir jelly after sugar is melted. Pour into glasses while hot and cover with tissue-paper dipped in hot milk. “K.A.V.”: Preserved Cumquats: Pick very firm fruit, and before putting them into preserving-pan serving-pan prick well with a darner and boil well in plenty of water till tender. Now make a syrup of 141 b. sugar and | pint water to each pound of fruit. Boil syrup for 20 minutes, then add fruit and boil 15 minutes longer. Bottle while hot. Sweet Cumquat Pickle: Peel 12 large cumquats, cut into thick slices and discard seeds. Steam in a double boiler till tender and translucent, then put aside. Boil for 25 minutes 2 cups sugar with 1| cup vinegar gar and 1 teaspoon each of whole cloves and broken cinnamon tied in a muslin bag. Lift out the bag, add fruit to vinegar and simmer slowly on a low heat for at least 1 hour. Pot as usual and leave at least 3 weeks before using with cold meat.

If, however, ever, “ Woman Carpenter ” has already bought the ordinary flbro sheets she can make the wall soundproof by tacking flooring-felt, such as is used under linoleum, to the battens of framework before fore nailing the outer sheets into position. The wall will thus be lined with felt. “Dormab"" : Having erected the frame for the dividing wall, nail the iibro sheets to one side of the partition. On the opposite side tack hessian across the studs to a height of Bft. and fill the cavity thus made with sawdust, charcoal or buzzer-chips i from a planing-machine), and then nail on flbro sheets to complete the wall. There will be an unfilled cavity of 2ft. between the padded wall and the ceiling of 10ft. high, but it is obviously impossible to fill the wall completely, and it will be quite soundproof. It would be possible to fill the cavity between the sheets of fibro with sawdust as each sheet is put up, without using the hessian support, but it would be more tedious. “Try Me”: Newspapers tightly wedged between tween the two walls will make them soundproof, proof, and the tighter the paper is rammed in the less risk of fire. I know a block of offices where this method was used and there have been no complaints. Whichever medium is selected, “Woman Carpenter” should first ask her insurance company if it will affect the policy. ' “Jimmy” : The chemically treated and dried seaweed sold under various names for insulation tion packing is the least expensive, is clean, easily handled and is recommended by Alex Smith in his Home Carpentry. However, I believe lieve insurance companies prohibit packing of any kind in hollow walls. Dlm-sims “Sometime” ; It has taken some time, but I have just got from a Chinese cook the recipe for Dim-sims wanted by “Curious” (W.M. 12/12/’B3) : Mix 11b. rice-flour to a firm paste with boiling water, roll out as thinly as possible sible and wipe the surface over with a little hot peanut oil. Cut paste into (approx.) 36 square pieces. Chop up finely |lb. fat pork, £lb. shrimps, 2oz, chestnuts and_ 2oz. Chinese mushrooms (weighed before soaking). Mix all these ingredients together, put a little of the mixture on each square of paste, fold in triangular angular shape and press the edges together (when made in the shape of old-fashioned money-bags they are called Gow-gees). Place in one layer only in each basin, and steam. (Chinese mushrooms are dried and may be bought at Chinese provision shops.) Keeping Green Leaves “Sealeaf” ; Tell “Grove” (W.M. 13/3/’34) to lay fresh green leaves on a table and wipe each separately with a soft cloth which has been dipped in a solution of warm water strongly scented with eucalyptus oil. When dry press between the leaves of a book, place a weight on and put in a dark air-tight cupboard. Leaves treated in this way will retain their color for years. “Hey” : Boil 41b. powdered size or glue in 1 pint water till dissolved. solved. Leave till cool, then dip each leaf into the glue separately and spread them out to dry. Press them, then re-dip, dry press again, using a cold and heavy iron we /fbt to do so. ... “C.H. : This is how we preserved beechleaves leaves in England; the method is worth trying for other foliage. Pick the leaves while they are fresh and green and stand the stalks for 34 hours in a strong solution of salt and water, Then remove them and stand them in a halfand-half and-half mixture of glycerine and water. Let them remain until they cease to absorb any further moisture; they will then gradually change from green to golden brown and develop a rich and glossy appearance, while retaining their natural shape. ‘‘Jane’ : This is an old English recipe: Pick ZS pIM « pap-J, -J, mnicturp hoo pvnnnrDtprl Thp an irk dr -in- keens the leaves frorn fadin'odrying drying keeps the leaves from lading. Treacle Peanut Drops “Pop” : This is my recipe for treacle peanut toffee (“Sweetie,” W.M. 18/3/’34) ; Put 21b. each of treacle and brown sugar into a pan with 2 heaped tablespoons butter, allow to melt slowly, then boil up the toffee, stirring it all the time, and continue stirring till it becomes brittle when a spoonful is dropped into cold water. Add a little vanilla flavoring, pour the whole into an oiled tin, mark into squares and p ress a roasted peanut into each square. When cold break each square off and wrap in waxed paper. “Wei”: Put into a pan lib. brown sugar, 2oz. butter, 41b. black treacle, 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Bring slowly to the boil, and boil steadily for 25 minutes, Have the peanuts all shelled and prepared, then with a darning-needle dip each peanut in the toffee and set aside on a greased slide to cool, When cold wrap singly in waxed paper. The toffee left over makes excellent eating plain if packed in an air-tight tin. “Elwood” ; One cup of treacle, 1 cup each of white and brown sugar, 2 cups grated chocolate late and 1 cup milk or cream into which has been stirred 1 dessertspoon ground rice. Rub chocolate to a paste with a little of the milk or cream, mix entire ingredients together and boil i hour, taking care it doesn’t burn. Pour into-a buttered dish, and when cool enough to handle break off small pieces, place a roasted peanut in each piece, roll into tiny balls and wrap in waxed paper. “Rothy” ; Cook over a slow fire 2 cups granulated lated sugar, i cup cold water and J cup treacle till a drop of the syrup crackles in cold water. Add 1 tablespoon butter and i teaspoon vanilla essence. Beat 2 egg-whites to a stiff froth, then pour mixture over them, beating all the time, and beat briskly for a few minutes. Pour into small greased tin rings and place a peanut in the centre of each. Remove in 15 minutes and roll up. Cumquat Recipes “Jane” : “C-F.,” who wants cumquat recipes (W.M. 13/3/’34), will like these: Cumquat Conserve: Pick 6 doz. cpmquats with the stems on and leave for 3 days, till the stems will rub off without leaving a hole (which would allow the salt water to enter and spoil the conserve). Put cumquats in preserving-pan and just cover with cold water with 1 cup of salt added ; boil gently for | hour and strain off the water. Put on again in hoiliny water and 1 teaspoon of bicarb, soda, boil 20 minutes and strain water off once more. Now prick the fruit all over with a fork and then weigh. Make a syrup of 11b. sugar and 1 cup water to every pound of fruit and boil 3 hours or till syrup is very thick. Put while hot into wide-necked jars and put on lids or cover with tissue-paper soaked in hot milk. Cumquat Jelly: Soak cumquats for 24 hours in salt and water (about 1 cup salt to 1 gallon water). Pour off the water and cut the cumquats into quarters or thick slices and add 1 Lisbon lemon (cut up) to every dozen cumquats. Put fruit in preserving-pan with enough water to float it and boil for 2 hours or till quite tender. Strain without squeezing through a flannel jelly-bag and then add 1 cup sugar to 1 cup juice and boil for about i hour, or until it jells. Do not stir jelly after sugar is melted. Pour into glasses while hot and cover with tissue-paper dipped in hot milk. “K.A.V.”: Preserved Cumquats: Pick very firm fruit, and before putting them into preserving-pan serving-pan prick well with a darner and boil well in plenty of water till tender. Now make a syrup of 141 b. sugar and | pint water to each pound of fruit. Boil syrup for 20 minutes, then add fruit and boil 15 minutes longer. Bottle while hot. Sweet Cumquat Pickle: Peel 12 large cumquats, cut into thick slices and discard seeds. Steam in a double boiler till tender and translucent, then put aside. Boil for 25 minutes 2 cups sugar with 1| cup vinegar gar and 1 teaspoon each of whole cloves and broken cinnamon tied in a muslin bag. Lift out the bag, add fruit to vinegar and simmer slowly on a low heat for at least 1 hour. Pot as usual and leave at least 3 weeks before using with cold meat. "

Enfield, N.S.W., wants the words and music of the song, “My Wish for Thee.” Air Comfort “Mark” : Having travelled by air between Sydney and Brisbane on several occasions, 1 would adv i s e “Terrafirraer” (W.M. 14/4/’3G) to relax as much as possible during the flight. When making my first journey by air I was inclined to brace myself each time the plane encountered an air-pocket, and though the trip was not a particularly rough one I felt very squeamish, and as glad when the journey was over, though I was not actually air-sick. Before my next trip a friend who had done a good deal of flying gave me good advice, and I have followed this on each occasion, and have enjoyed the flight. The advice was to take a | grain of calomel every other night for a week before the trip, and to follow the dose of calomel with a seidlitz-powder the next morning. Further advice was : Completely relax in a comfortable position and try not to “stiffen” or brace when the plane goes into a pocket. I am not a good sea-traveller and on numerous occasions have also been train-sick, hut have not yet been really air-sick, and I certainly prefer this means of travel to any other. “Spes” ; Sit as naturally in the plane as you would in a car, getting “comfy.” Take your seat early with an interesting hook, start to read and keep on reading the whole way if yon are inclined to feel nervous or sick. If you cannot read, shut your eyes and lean back; if you go to sleep all the better. Do not bother about special meals, etc., before a flight, hut take a tablespoon of pure lemon-juice before embarking. Should the plane be one of the new passenger ones with blinds, lower it over the porthole should looking out make you dizzy. Select, if possible, a seat by yourself. self. Just think you are in a land vehicle and forget yourself. Many times I have found that closed eyes neutralised a very bumpy air passage. H ome-made Skis “Em” : “Dinah,” who asks for a method of treating hardwood (W.M. 14/4/’36), should be careful not to use any that will crack easily or splinter. I would advise her not to trust home-made skis. They are never so safe and reliable as the imported ones nor as satisfactory factory to wear. Jimmy ’ : As “Dinah” can have the wood steam-bent, the only other preparation it requires is oiling. To do that warm some raw linseed oil and rub it well into the wood for at least one month, every day doing a little to. it, just as one would prepare a bat for cricket. The thongs should be treated too, using mutton-tallow and raw oil if possible. Ash or maple are the best woods for the purpose, being tough, hut Australian hickory or spotted gum could be used for these, though not so tough as the first two mentioned. Chow Gan “Quaynur” : Extensive inquiries among my Chinese friends for a recipe for Chow Gan (W.M, 14/4/’36) brought to light the two following recipes for the dish, which is evidently capable of variation : Chow Gan No. 1 : Two tomatoes (small), 2 eggs, 1 packet Chinese macaroni, 1 tin bamboo shoots, £lb. peas, 6 dried mushrooms, rooms, soy sauce, |lb. fresh prawns, peanut oil. Boil macaroni roni in salted water till soft. Beat eggs and fry (like an omelet) in a little peanut oil. hen 1 ried hard remove from pan and cut into thin strips. Slice bamboo shoots into thin slices; also cut into small pieces the mushrooms rooms that have previously been soaked in cold water for about 15 minutes. Shell prawns and cut in halves ; cut onion into small pieces Mix all these ingredients together and fry lightly in the oil. Remove from the pan and add to the egg-strips. Strain the macaroni and fry in the oil till golden brown, add the other fried ingredients and the tomatoes (sliced) and cook till tomatoes are soft. Just before serving ing add the green peas (previously boiled and strained) and serve with soy sauce. Tomatoes may be omitted, but the Chinese dish invariably ably contains them. Enough for six persons Vliaic Gan No. 2: Two eggs, lean pork, lib. peas, 2 tomatoes, 1 handful dried mushrooms, rooms, |lb. dried oysters, 1 tin bamboo shoots, onion, soy sauce. Cut pork, bamboo shoots and onion into small thick pieces, place in a saucepan and just cover with cold water. Add mushrooms and oysters (previously soaked In cold water until soft) and simmer 1| hour, then add topiatoes and simmer another J hour. Beat eggs well and about five minutes before serving stir them into the stew. Cook the green peas in a separate saucepan, strain, and add to the other ingredients just before serving. Enough for six persons. ‘‘Bitty Sing” : The Chow Gan of the Yangtze contains chopped ham or pork as well as the vegetables, but it depends for its “moreishness” on a paste made of milk, eggs and rice-flour. This is mixed to a dough, rolled out flat and cut into ribbons, which are dropped into the dish (putting the gan into chow, so to speak). It is served at important banquets and is as tasty as chop suey. Bread That Goes Damp “Inedo” : “Ment” (W.M. 14/4/’36), whose bread goes damp after cooking, probably allows her oven to cool off too much in the second half-hour of baking. Bread should be put iuto a hot oven for half an-hour, after which the oven should be allowed to cool off a little, enough heat being maintained to thoroughly cook the bread and dry out the moisture, otherwise the loaf will “sweat.” As soon as the bread is cooked remove from the tins and stand the batch on end against some object to allow free circulation of air around it. The time for baking depends on the size of the batch and the oven. For a medium-size batch an hour is usually enough, but a large batch vill need fully ten minutes longer. If --Ment” has a small stove she should try making smaller loaves; the extra dough can be made into cottage loaves or bread rolls and baked later. If the batch is big it almost fills a small oven, leaving no room for air, and steam then causes the dampness. “Doit” : After the bread is fully cooked and taken out of the tins it should be put back into the oven for ten minutes. If the fire is too hot the door can be left open, but as a rule the oven should be cooling off and will not brown it more. Cottage loaves cooked without tins will not need this treatment, as only the tin loaves are ever likely to sweat. “Lyu R.” : I think that after baking “Ment” has rolled the bread in a cloth, causing the loaves to steam. When taken from the oven it should be reared up against, say, a pasteboard board covered lightly with a cloth. It is advisable able to have the cloth in between the board and the bread, too, as the slightest touch will “dent” a newly-baked loaf. * “Europenut”: New form of graft! A friend over the border was envied much by me for many years for the enormous bundle of letters the postmistress handed to her. “Mirror friends,” she explained, then added with a wink, “the Mirror used to run a free pen-friends column, but the mean money-grabbers now make a charge. But I get back on them. I insert a free request for something many people possess. From that I receive shoals of letters. I choose the best and keep the writers as pen-friends.

Cooking Salt Herrings “No. 13 Strathfield"" ; Perhaps “Auckland"" (W.M. 3/8/’37) would like to try my method of cooking salt herrings. It is the way this fish is prepared in the Shetland Isles, N. 8., and we often have them here (in N.S.W.) for supper as a treat. Allow two medium-sized potatoes and one herring for each person. Scrub the potatoes, but do not peel or scrape, and wash the herring, preferably in running water: remove head and tail, but leave the roe in. Cook potatoes in unsalted water for 10 minutes, add the herrings and cook till potatoes are ready; drain and steam for one minute with lid on, then dish. The potatoes absorb a certain amount of the salt as well as the flavor of the fish and those who enjoy salt herrings will always cook them in this way. In the olden da vs in Shetland land all salt fish was cooked like this, along with the potatoes in their jackets. “Bennachie” : Coming from a land where salt herrings are a staple article of food, I find from experience this method a reliable one : Soak herrings overnight in water. Next morning ing drain off brine, wash in fresh water, removing ing any loose scab's or gut, and'leave in water till ready to cook. About J hour before required place herrings in fresh water, adding h teaspoon spoon of sugar to the quart, and bring to the boil. Don’t - allow to boil but drain off this water, covering fish again with boiling water and same amount of sugar. Cook slowly till done—about .» minutes—and remove immediately diately from water. Dish up, minus heads and tails, heat J cup of tomato sauce and pour over, or serve with white sauce and mashed potatoes. Various ways will suggest themselves selves of using the cooked fish, but this method of removing the salt remains the same. “Scotty Pat"" : The best way to take excess salt from herrings is to soak them for twelve hours in buttermilk ; if that is unprocurable, make some milk sour by adding a teaspoon of cream of tartar to fresh milk. After fish have soaked the required time, take from the milk and wash in cold water. This way to cook the herrings is, I think, the best 1 have tasted: Take heads off. split open flat, roll up into a ball and lay them in a pie-dish till it is packed full. Add 1 cup cold water and I cup vinegar, sprinkle with grated nutmeg and bake in hot oven 1 hour. The herrings require no boning as the vinegar dissolves the bones. This is a delicious dish eaten either hot or cold. “Blue Darns” : The simplest and most delicious way to serve salted herrings is just how they are served in Scottish fishing villages as “Taties an’ herrin’."" Potatoes must be boiled in their jackets then “dry” steamed to make the cracks “floury.” The herrings should 1)0 soaked overnight, brought to boiling point in fresh water, which is then poured off and replaced with fresh cold water. Boil till tender. Sometimes it is necesary to use three waters. Butter is sometimes eaten with this dish. Mustard Sauce “Aitchess” : If “A.E.F.” (W.M. G/7/%37) isn’t yet suited lot her try this sauce : Put into a saucepan pan the contents of a large bottle of Worcestershire sauce and half a large bottle of brown vinegar and boil. Meanwhile mix in a basin J cup white sugar, 1 large cup flour, ,‘{ teaspoons mustard, 2 teaspoons curry-powder and a good pinch of salt. Add a little vinegar to make a paste, stir into the boiling sauce and vinegar, boil quickly for a few minutes, then . ... , strain through a strainer and buttle while hot. When cooled a little cork down. This thick brown sauce will keep for years if stored in a cool place. Ushant to Scilly “Cabotia” : In case “Myadgo” hasn't yet got the ballad she inquired for in W.M. 3/8/217 tell her it’s a sea chanty called “Spanish Ladies.’’ < )ne verse of it runs : Well rant and ire'll roar like true British sailors, Well rant and we'll roar across the blue seas Until a-e find soundings in the Channel of old England , From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues. New England Love Cake “Dot”: Here are two ways of making the New England Love Cakes wanted by “Angela” (W.M. 13/8/’37). The first is for sweet plain ones, the others are iced. (a) Weigh Jib. blanched almonds, brown them ever so little in the .oven, pound them very finely and add Jib. sugar. Moisten with an egg, roll into balls and harden in a slow oven for 20 minutes. Place in a cloth full of fine sugar till required. {h) Mix 6oz. sugar, soz. ground almonds and 3 egg-whites beaten to a froth. Turn into a shallow greased tin, spread evenly over and put into a moderate oven until set, but not hard. Remove from oven, leave in tin but cut into small rounds with a pastry-cutter. Return to oven to finish cooking, then carefully remove each round. Return crumbs to oven and bake until crisp and brown. Crush them. Mix 4oz icing sugar, 2oz. butter and flavor with coffee essence. Spread rounds with this and sandwich two together. Ice sides, roll in the crushed crumbs, spread tops with icing and put a dot of melted chocolate on each. “YsabeT’ : These are “Love Cakes"" but they may not come from New England: Mix (5 tablespoons flour and 2 tablespoons sugar, rub in 3oz. fresh butter and mix to a dough with a beaten egg. Knead well and add a little water if too dry to roll out. Leave aside for 2 hours, roll out to J inch thickness and cut into 2 by 4 inch pieces. Brush with jam. coter half of sections with a layer of almond paste and place other sections on top. Brush each with beaten egg-white, dust with ground almonds and bake 20 mintues in quick oven.

Ushant to Scilly “Cabotia” : In case “Myadgo” hasn't yet got the ballad she inquired for in W.M. 3/8/217 tell her it’s a sea chanty called “Spanish Ladies.’’ < )ne verse of it runs : Well rant and ire'll roar like true British sailors, Well rant and we'll roar across the blue seas Until a-e find soundings in the Channel of old England , From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues. New England Love Cake “Dot”: Here are two ways of making the New England Love Cakes wanted by “Angela” (W.M. 13/8/’37). The first is for sweet plain ones, the others are iced. (a) Weigh Jib. blanched almonds, brown them ever so little in the .oven, pound them very finely and add Jib. sugar. Moisten with an egg, roll into balls and harden in a slow oven for 20 minutes. Place in a cloth full of fine sugar till required. {h) Mix 6oz. sugar, soz. ground almonds and 3 egg-whites beaten to a froth. Turn into a shallow greased tin, spread evenly over and put into a moderate oven until set, but not hard. Remove from oven, leave in tin but cut into small rounds with a pastry-cutter. Return to oven to finish cooking, then carefully remove each round. Return crumbs to oven and bake until crisp and brown. Crush them. Mix 4oz icing sugar, 2oz. butter and flavor with coffee essence. Spread rounds with this and sandwich two together. Ice sides, roll in the crushed crumbs, spread tops with icing and put a dot of melted chocolate on each. “YsabeT’ : These are “Love Cakes"" but they may not come from New England: Mix (5 tablespoons flour and 2 tablespoons sugar, rub in 3oz. fresh butter and mix to a dough with a beaten egg. Knead well and add a little water if too dry to roll out. Leave aside for 2 hours, roll out to J inch thickness and cut into 2 by 4 inch pieces. Brush with jam. coter half of sections with a layer of almond paste and place other sections on top. Brush each with beaten egg-white, dust with ground almonds and bake 20 mintues in quick oven. "
Jujube Jam; Jujube Pie; Jujube Sauce,96,96,233171289,https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-426956812,To the Rescue (26 February 1935),Article; Article/Journal or magazine article,1935,Article,Australian; Australia--Social life and customs--Periodicals.; Women--Australia--Periodicals.,,The Australian woman's mirror.,"To the Rescue “Jujubes,” the Chinese Fruit “H.R.H."" ; I once had a jujubetree, tree, or Chinese apple, and recommend mend to ""Jujubes” (W.M. 29/l/’35) three of my recipes: Jujube Jam: Put a few handfuls of jujubes in a saucepan with just enough water to cover, boil till soft, take off the fire, add the juice of a lemon and measure. For every cup of pulp add 1 cup of sugar, and boil up again till it jellies. Quite a change from ordinary jams. Jujube Pie: Wash the required number of jujubes and put into a saucepan with a little water, a few drops of lemon-juice and enough sugar to sweeten. Simmer slowly for about 1 hour, when they should be nice and soft, but not broken. Put into a pie-dish, cover with a nice short paste and bake. Delicious served with custard. Jujube Sauce: Three pounds of jujubes, teaspoon cayenne, 4OZ. cloves, a little salt, J teaspoon of ground ginger. 1J pint vinegar and a little burnt sugar to make it a dark color. Put ingredients into a saucepan and boil all together until the stones separate. Strain, and bottle hot. Nice with cold meat. “Quaynur” : The Chinese fruit, jujubes, are not known to the Chinese in my district (Young, N.S.W.). Perhaps the correct name is something like “kaw chu ju,” which is similar in appearance to the grape-fruit but smaller. It is really a species of banana and can be used in the same way as an ordinary banana. Soldering Flux “A.” ; “Tinsmithess,” who seeks a recipe for a jellied flux (W.M. 29/l/’3o), will find any of these satisfactory ; (1) Dissolve Jib. pulverised verised resin in J pint methylated spirit, making ing the solution like thick syrup. (2) Dissolve loz. glycerine and loz. lactic acid in 1 cup water. (3) “Kill” 1 pint hydrochloric acid with clean scrap zinc, then add J pint glycerine cerine previously mixed with J pint alcohol. The foregoing are non-corroding fluxes. (4) This one is in soft stick form : In a porcelain container dissolve zinc cuttings in 4oz. muriatic acid, and add ooz. water. Strain mixture to remove zinc residue and add IJoz. powdered sal ammoniac. Stir well and stand till liquid has evaporated. The crystallised substance thus reduced to fine powder is mixed with 3oz. of melted paraffin-wax and poured into a cardboard board tube fitted with a cap. “Blue Wren” : This “soldering fat” for tinware ware has my husband’s recommendation, and “Tinsmithess” will find it preferable to ordinary resins, etc., as it can be more easily removed after the soldering job is done. Take 3 parts of beef-tallow, 5 parts resin and 3 parts olive oil. Melt them all thoroughly together, stirring ring well, then add 1 part powdered sal ammoniac dissolved in as little water as possible. A “soldering fat” for iron is made of 1 part of olive oil to 1 part of powdered sal ammoniac. For aluminium, the “soldering fat” is made by melting together equal parts of resin and tallow, half the quantity of zinc chloride being then added. Derwent Fish Patties “L.A.L.” : This may be the Tasmhnian recipe “Two Years After” (W.M, 29/l/’35) asks for. It used to be made in ray old home in Tasmania years ago, and I have tasted it nowhere else; it is delicious: Bone and flake enough cooked fish, preferably a dry variety, to fill a large cup. Now make a very thick sauce: Boil 1 cup of milk with pepper, salt and a pinch of powdered mace, a dessertspoon of butter and a teaspoon of anchovy sauce and thicken with two heaped tablespoons of cornflour mixed with milk. Mix in the fish and a well-beaten egg, shape into halls with flour and fry golden brown in deep boiling fat or butter. If the mixture is nob stiff enough, add some breadcrumbs. Serve with parsley sauce or hot tomato sauce. The sauce into which the fish is stirred should be as thick as dough. “Hamara” : If the patties had a flavor somewhat what resembling lobster they were made from scallops, a shell-fish plentiful along the Derwent. went. Since coming to Melbourne I had not seen them until a few months ago, when I learned that mainland shops were now receiving ing regular supplies. The patties are made as follows; Separate the scallops from the shell, add a little water and simmer for a few minutes; on no account allow to boil, as this toughens the fish. Make a batter with 4 tablespoons s.-r. flour, a pinch of bicarb, soda, salt and water —using the liquid the scallops were cooked in. Dip each scallop in and fry till a golden brown. Another way of cooking scallops is to make a good white sauce, drop in the scallops after removing from shell and simmer for four minutes. Serve with dry toast. Badly-running Cupboard Drawers “Queue” : “M.” will find that she can prevent the cupboard drawers from sticking (W.M. 29/l/’35) if she rubs a little beeswax on the sides and on the lower edges of the drawers and polishes well. The secret is to rub the wax vigorously till it is polished to a hard, smooth finish. If the drawers stick only slightly, a bar of hard yellow soap may be rubbed on. A black lead-pencil also gives a smooth surface, but for bad cases I have found the wax the most satisfactory. “Running Late” : If “M.” gives the entire drawer a coat of thin varnish, allowing it to dry thoroughly before replacing it, she will probably find the trouble is overcome. The same trouble affected a chest-of-drawers until each drawer was enamelled inside and out, to complete a color-scheme, when we were surprised prised to find they ran quite smoothly in all weathers. A paperhanger explained that the painting had rendered the wood quite watertight tight and prevented swelling. “Mardi” : “M.” will find that if she removes the drawers and applies furniture-polish to all surfaces which make contact they will run quite easily. I have treated all the drawers in my house in this way and they open and close with the slightest effort. “McPherson” ; Give a good coat of candlegrease grease to the top and bottom edges of the drawers, and the wooden slides on which they run. The grease can be easily applied if a lighted match is held against the bottom of the candle to soften it.

Cut the cellophane into circular pieces' the required size, dip iu water, and press down over the tops of the jars. Then tie a thread of cotton round the neck of the bottle over the cover, or, better still, affix with a rubber band (obtainable at most stores for a few pence a hundred). “Transparent” : Sandwiches and cakes keep fresh and look very appetising in cellophane. Large pieces could be used for covering books, protecting the covers from greasy finger-marks and at the same time leaving the titles and (in the case of tiny tots’ books) the cover picture quite visible. Some pieces could be kept for wrapping dainty Christmas gifts, thus adding to their attractivenes. It would also be handy to wrap dainty dress accessories such as silk stockings, scarves, gloves, evening-bags or special sets of lingerie, thus keeping them uncrushed and safe from insects. If “E.R.W.” has a “bottom drawer” each piece of work could be cellophane-wrapped and left so covered when shown to admiring friends, thus avoiding that soiled appearance much-handled work assumes. An attractive shoulder-posy can be made by cutting the pellophane into squares of either two, three or four inches. Fold each square cornerwise, then cornerwise again and gather along the cut edges.

D.” is expert she would be well advised to rely on the thermometer. “Florenc” : Proper dipping-chocolate known as ‘covering chocolate” must always be used to get a really glossy finish. Covering must be done in a warm, dry, airy room, and never on a damp, foggy day, for the sweets will take too long to set and lose their gloss. If the chocolate is the right temperature, it will set almost at once and be shining and glossv. Here is a good chocolate dip: Take |lb of sweet block chocolate, £lb. of unsweetened and a little cocoa butter. Or use |lb. of the sweetened block chocolate and a piece of cocoa butter the size of a walnut. "

Beche-de-mer “ Sandy ” : Referrin g to “ Beche's ” request ( W.M. lt)/(j/'3<5) for a recipe for soup made from beche-de-mer, ""Extrepanger,” trepanger,” the author of the article (W.M. 19/3/’3o) on smoking and drying trepang, to which “Beche” refers, informs me that what is reputed to be the most palatable form of beche-de-mer soup is one in which the trepang is stewed with greenturtle turtle flippers. The flippers should be skinned and the meat cut into small pieces. The bechede-mer de-mer should also be cut up, and stewed with the turtle meat slowly for an hour in beefstock. stock. Serve hot. ' “Quaynur” : To make soup from beche-demer mer first prepare the beche-de-mer in the following lowing way : Wash thoroughly inside and out and scrub lightly with a brush, then place in a dish, cover with water and soak overnight. Next morning put into a saucepan, cover with plenty of fresh water and boil for 3 hours. If at the end of that time the tropang still smells “fishy,” boil until the odor disappears, but not more than 4 hours. After boiling remove from the saucepan and wash again in cold water. The trepang is now ready for use. Always prepare sea-slug in this way, no matter how it is to be used later. To make the soup, make a good stock out of beef-bones and about J to 3 hour before serving add the beche-de-mer, cut into small pieces about J inch long. Also add about a finger-length of dried salted cabbage and two or three dried Chinese plums. (There is no substitute for the salted cabbage, but if the plums are unprocurable add half dozen raisins.) Garnish soup with finelycut cut shallots and serve with soy sauce. One beche-de-mer weighing about 4oz. would be enough in soup for 6 persons. If “Beche” would like a richer and thicker dish, she could use the following recipe : Gut about 21b. lean pork flank into small pieces, put into saucepan and cover well with water. Add a little dried salted cabbage. and a piece of crushed green ginger, bring contents of saucepan to the boil and then simmer for 3 hours. Soak three or four Ghinese mushrooms in cold water till soft. Gut 2 prepared trepang into pieces about li inch long and add mushrooms and beche-demer mer to saucepan contents an hour before serving ing (i.e., after the pork has been simmering for about 2 hours). Before serving add chopped shallots and serve with plain boiled rice and soy sauce. Enough for 6 to 8 persons. “Clegg”-: This recipe is a good one ; Trepang Soap: One quart clear brown stock, yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1 glass of sherry, 1 small bundle of beche-de-mer. Jib. mushrooms. Soak beche-de-mer in water three days beforehand, changing the water daily, then scrape and rinse and place in a saucepan covered with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer until soft and clear. Peel and slice mushrooms, add the stock and bring to the boil. Put into this the sliced beche-de-mer, bring to the boil again and simmer for one hour with the saucepan covered. Mash yolks of eggs with equal quantity tity of flour and mix to a firm paste with cold water. Rub through gravy-strainer into boiling soup. Boil for 2 or 3 minutes until particles are. cooked, then stir in sherry and a little cayenne pepper. Spotted Gloves “Harvey'’ : The spots on “Glove's” gloves (W.M. It>/6/’36) are most probably mildew spots, perhaps due to being kept in a damp place. To prevent this, keep the gloves in as warm and dry a place as possible. To remove the spots put the gloves into a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid with a piece of rock ammonia the size of a walnut. Leave for a few days if necessary (it depends on the time the stains have been on the gloves), then hang in a current of air till the odor goes away. “Tod” : Mix some fuller's earth with cold water to a cream, apply and leave for 24 hours. Brush off with a stiff brush, then put gloves on and rub in a dish of oatmeal. ""Kiltoi” : If the mildew is caused by perspiring hands 1 think nothing will remove it. To prevent it occurring air the gloves for a few minutes after taking them off, then shake a little talcum or starch-powder into each glove before putting them away. As an < xtra precaution wrap them in a piece of flannel or woollen material. Newcomers to Tasmania always experience this trouble with kid gloves—due to the damp atmosphere. The treatment I have outlined is adopted there. “Mrs. J. S.” : To restore the gloves put them on and rub the spots well with equal parts of warm water and pure turpentine on a fliece of flannel. Place in a breeze to dry. If very bad it may be necessary to use the spirit undiluted. The odor will disappear when dry. ""Era"" : Mix some starch (1 tablespoon will do 1 pair) to a paste with \ teaspoon of salt, 1 dessertspoon lemon-juice and J cup of boiling ing water. Apply and leave till dry. then rub off. Repeat if necessary, then clean with petrol, and when dry polish with light- or dark-tan shoe-polish, rubbing it well in and finishing with velveteen.
