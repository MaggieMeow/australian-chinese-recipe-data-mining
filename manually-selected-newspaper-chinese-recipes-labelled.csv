More water might be added if necessary. This aofpewtat complicated ""hodge-podge*' would well satisfy a middle-class family, and cost less, at any rate, than a joint It would not do perhaps every day, tat might occasionally save the meat and avoid the honor of stinting at dinner. For a cheaper dish, why should not Che lentil be intro duced for everyday use in ltnpio.^ as in France? For instance, let a pint of lentils be soaked in pure raft water for 24 hours; then put in a stewpan (earthen our enamelled is best), and boiled for four «H5f *""en two onions, one parsnip, one carrot. ^ and a small quantity of boiled nee should be added. This, mixed and boiled a short time together, would produce a sataBfymg and savouiy dish, somewhat better than the diet of the Belgian miner, and vet very cheap. Lentils are about the most nutritious vegetable we possess. In 100 lbs. they contain 84 agsnswptfnuBg flah-fomdng principle, and 14*3 that gives heat The nee has 82 per cent of the heat-forming principle. Compared with these, the other vege tables are more useful as Riving water, flavour, and and digestible. The cele brated Indian andChinese dish called dcM has «° lef!PJ? ^or if8 chief ingredient and is purely of vegetable matter, it ib rahstantijj «nri a 9nart ot split lentils till, they forma thick soup; nave ready a pound of nee, well boiled in tnillr, and dminaJ off as dry as possible. _ Shake the rice up loosely in a dun, an<L after mixing an ounce of currypowder with the lentils; poor the lentil soup over the rice and serve it up. Dishes, cheaper even than these, may be made palatable, fiefore concluding, how ever. there is one important objection which has often been made, through ignorance of the first rule in cooking vegetables. It is observed a meal from them is not satisfying. I have fnnn^ it frequently happen that the persons who thug objected did not know even how to boil a vegetable. The rule is simple, but must never be forgotten. Ujery kind of vegetable intended to be served whole.should, when put to boii, be placed atonce in boiling water; and this applies especially to potatoes and vegetables from which tbeouteroover has been removed. Now it often happens that potatoes, &c.. are, to save time, placed in cold water and left to boil gradually. It is just this which allows the nutritions nnfift to -""nre. and renders the meal unsatisfying. When/on the contrary, the water boils from the moment the vegetable is Immersed in it the albumen is partially coagulated near the surface, and serves to retain the virtue of the vegetable. The reverse is of comae the rale for making amp, or any dish from which the wattt wiDTnoTbe drained. By pladng tibe vegetables in cold water the albumen is atari? dissolved, and actually mixes with the water^a pro«s most neepmry for the production of nutritions soup. It ta to be hoped that thepomi who have a speaal need for the most theirmbaev can produc^ wiU learn, fa whatever haste thev may ""be, not to boil all the albumen from tiwr Potatoes, reserving for their meal only tWtarehy matter. -Food Journal, |",fresh meatperhaps s4aa5s3sssijft valuable information nimble procure fresh meat summer easy detect anv diflferpm meat preserve recently excelijent recipe botiung frxttt 9 lbs fruit nut 5 lbs white sugar come boil boil 10 minute fie careful stir fruit little possible braise p2r m5 earthenware vessel cool ejiiw m widenecke bottle cover nw gooseberry black cunant andt raspberry mix ir hardly tell fresh fnut specially recommend recipe antsesssa preserve fruit withotit sugar cnnant damson plum tfgiwh j epesetwo yearaand ff rygh   jubt bafhere garden soil froitsintlie usual way hve ready jar op widemouthe bottle d vapour cause throw little flour sdnhuron stove thevapour thejarfiu thefrst ett   pottible till inch ton btick little wax vesta match fruit leave pbosphorooa end stand inch bladder damp ready use set match tie quickly w urr1 kg 611 air exhaust   i1 ve know fruit tekhouslrecommend   toall orange marmalade cut orange seville half pulp sn thai bod peel large quantity water xvhljj1njpzigiv1 j water tinmm ffip dfalfd cat intoth thf pnjp skin pipe 5f f0 prtake equal weight   6011 lanp 5tly die pulp theadd c peel boil gently half hour peel orange wine employ cue thejuioe sweet orange substitute pulp skin sweet orange useless marmaladesm m fbe remove nnd throw yon basin   ta k duim bssss5ustarfflfiirfiitf chjmge water twice till itso traderthat head ofa pin easily pierce drain nod sieve cold remove silver knife white cut fine strip add pulp juice alto strain lemon juice nro 2itip dj lemon dozen orange weigh pound equal weight coarse lump sugar let orange bou minute add sugar boil till marmalade clear nice consistency stuie time boil thick scum tiw ofl rise nearly cold store jar usegeoegiana j j cook vegetable chean tasty substantial dishuet suggest h9usewife grate carrot turnip parsnip little beetroot artichoke pintof split pais boil st fsj5 hure boil inth tessponfuis indsstwhstet scotch med mixed cold water leave simmer hour little parsley mint thyme flavour dish water add necessary aofpewtat complicated hodgepodge satisfy middleclass family cost rate joint day tat occasionally save meat avoid honor stint dinner cheap dish che lentil intro duce everyday use ltnpio france instance let pint lentil soak pure raft water 24 hour stewpan earthen enamel good boil h5f en onion parsnip carrot   small quantity boil nee add mix boil short time produce satabfymg savouiy dish somewhat well diet belgian miner vet cheap lentil nutritious vegetable possess 100 lbs contain 84 agsnswptfnubg flahfomdng principle 143 give heat nee 82 cent heatforme principle compare vege table useful rive water flavour digestible cele brate indian andchinese dish call dcm   lefpj if8 chief ingredient purely vegetable matter ib rahstantijj nri 9nart ot split lentil till forma thick soup nave ready pound nee boil tnillr dminaj dry possible _ shake rice loosely dun anl mix ounce currypowder lentil poor lentil soup rice serve dish cheap palatable fiefore conclude important objection ignorance rule cooking vegetable observe meal satisfy fnnn frequently happen person thug object know boil vegetable rule simple forget ujery kind vegetable intend serve wholeshould boii place atonce boiling water apply especially potato vegetable tbeouteroover remove happen potato c save time place cold water leave boil gradually allow nutrition nnfift nre render meal unsatisfying whenon contrary water boil moment vegetable immerse albuman partially coagulate near surface serve retain virtue vegetable reverse comae rale make amp dish wattt widtnotbe drain pladng tibe vegetable cold water albuman atari dissolve actually mix watera pro neepmry production nutrition soup ta hope thepomi speaal need theirmbaev produc wiu learn fa haste thev boil albuman tiwr potato reserve meal twtarehy matter food journal,1870,dahl

After many inquiries I am un able to tell you where green ginger roots can be bought, but I can give you an excellent substitute if you wish to preserve ginger for your own use. Take the common dry ? ginger, selecting large pieces, put them in cold water, place on the fire, and simmer until tender; when done put into cold water; take mit-and drain. ?Weigh the irin^er and an equal weight of wkite'sugaw- Clarify the sugar, and when the syrup, is hot add the gingeraud. simmer constantly^ until the -sugar has-penetrated right ? through the gingejv Do not use 'the sugar too hot or the ginger will shrink and not take -.the-ugar. By a little care in preparation a preserve quite equal to that for which the Chinese are bo famed may be made. N.B.— To clarify the' 'sugar, allow the white of one egg and a pint of water to every 21b. of sugar. Beat the whits of the egg well, put the sugar and water in a pre serving pan or enamelled, saucepan, add the white of the egg, stir until the sugar is dissolved. 'When this is done ? put the saucepan on the firf, and when the syrup boils throw into it a teacupful of cold water, and do not stir the syrup after this is added. Bring it to the boiling point again, and then place the pan by the side of the fire for the contents to settle. Remove all the sugar, placing it on a sieve so that any Byrup running from it may be boiled up again, and must also be well skimmed. About 20 minutes will be required for the sugar to dissolve, and little more than five for it to boil. -2. A good recipe for grape jam was given in the Mail, for 8th December. For Peach Jam : Pare the peaches as thinly as possible, to remove the skin ; cut them in halves, remove the stones, and weigh. Allow lib. of loaf sugar to, each pound of fruit ; arrange the fruit on a large dish in layers, sprink ling each layer with sugar finely pounded; cover and leave them overnight. Next morning f et the fruit and syrup on to boil ; have the stones cracked and the kernels blanched; add these to the fruit, simmer until tender and transparent; then pour into jars and seal. Be sure to keep this preserve in a dry, cool place, and if glass jars are used wrap them well in brown paper to prevent the action of the light, Peach jam is one of the most deli cate to manage and diificult to keep. Quince Jam: Pare and core the quinces; put the skins and cores, broken so as to free the pips, in an enamelled pan ; over with enough water to float them, and boil for two or three hours. Slice the quinces, weiirh, and allow three quarters of a pound of best loaf sugar to each pound of fruit. Put the fruit into a preserving pan with cold water sufficient to float and boil until reduced to a pulp (about three hoard) ; strain the skins and cores through a sieve, and add the liquid to the pulp, put in the sugar and boil for about 40 minutes until the fruit jellies. Quince Jelly ? Wash the fruit, and wipe each quince dry. He move the stalk and eye, but do not pare the quinces ; slice the fruit leaving the cores in (or what is niora eco nomical, pare the fruit and remove the cores, placing the rind and cores in a muslin bag, tie securely and put in with the fruit) ; put into a preserving pan with sufficient water to float the fruit. Boil until the slices are reduced to pulp; strain off the dear juice— without press sing— through a cheese-cloth ; measure the juice, and to each pint allow lib of loaf sugar. Boil juice and sugar together for about three-quarter* of an hour, stir with a wooden spoon and skim off the scum aB it rises, when the jelly poems firm upon a little being poured on a plate it is done. The bag of ricins and cores to betaken out of the pulp, weigh the latter, and allow half a pound of sugar to each pound. Boil for about lfl minntes. .This will make a very good -jam or marmalade for puddings, &c, but will not keep long. Apple .Telly ; To every 21b. of apples allow one pint of water; pare, core, and slice the apples, putting them with the above proportion of water into a jar. Cover the jar well, and put it into a cool oven over night. Next morning, when the juice is thoroughly drawn and the slices are soft and pulpy, strain through a jelly baar. Do not squeeze the bag.

Ovum. — Eggs can be kept perfectly sound for six months by coating each one with the white of egg. Apply it with the finger so that every spot is touched, then pack the eggs in a box in any position you wish, putting a layer of paper between every layer of eggs, and set the box away in a cool, dry place. The white of one egg will coat from eight to 10 dozen. Souchong. — Professor German See, in a lecture on the diet ot patients, delivered at tbe Hotel Dieu, Paris, referred to tea as the best of beverages. It is the best digestive drink, but should be taken after quick infusion. Professor See ridicules certain remarks made about tea-drinking, and declared it was the surest means of sustaining intellectual energy. W. A. L. (Sydney). — The latest returns of the popula tion of Sydney and eiiburbs that we are in. possession of are to December 31, 1888. The -city of Sydney alone (at that date) had 127,449 inhabitants; the suburbs, 239,235; the city and suburbs together, 366,684; the country, 719,056. The tots! population of the colony was 1, 08o,74(). Melbourne and its suburbs had 437)785 inhabitants. Railway.— The railroads of the world are worth from five to six thousand million pounds sterling. This probably represents 1- 10th of the total wealth of civilised nations and one-quarter if not one-third of their invested capital. - It is doubtful whether the aggregate plant used in all manufacturing industries can equal it in value. The capital engaged in bank ing is but a trifle beside it. The world's whole stock of money of every kind— gold, silver, and paper would purchase only a thitd of its railroads. F. M. J. — 1. We gave full directions re Frenchpolish ing in reply to ' Amateur,' Upper Adelong, in our issue of December 7 last. The description of the process is lengthy. You may obtain a copy by ?mndinfr to the office. 2. We have made inquiries respecting the polish used by the Chinese, and cannot obtain the information. 'We understand that it is a trade secret with tbem, and of course we cannot ex pect them to impart it. If you desire to purchase it communicate with Mr. Quong Tart, King-street. T. R. (Cooranbong).— By the {.kindness of Mr. Quong Tart, of King-street, we are enabled to furnish you with the following recipe for preserving Chinese melon by the Chinese method First cut, peelrcut the soft out, leaving the firm fruit; perforate it; 121b melon, loz. or 2oz. soda ; soak in .cold water for a few hours and pour off water, &c. Subject to strong stream of water from tap; place in bouer till water boils, then dispense with water; then add sugar candv or honey ; boil till the whole forms a firm naste Saddlesteaf (Warren). — All we can say in reply to your querv is that the name is not mentioned in the Register of Medical Practitioners for 1889. This,, register is compiled by the New South Wales Medical j Board, and purports to be a list of medical practi tioners who are registered tinder the provisions of the Acts of Parliament of New South Wales, 2nd Vic. Ho. 22, 9th Vic. No. 12, 19th .Vic. No. 17, and 3lst Vic. cap. xxix of tbe Imperial Parliament. It is stated therein, however, that there may be inaccu . racies in the list. S. F. (New South Wales)i— If you do not wish to go into doep mourning (that is, heavy black) for an uncle or an aunt, we-do not consider it is out .of the way for you to wear a coloured dress with band of crape on left ami. We believe tbat it is now nut at all uncommon ; but the colour of the dress should not be too pronounced. The funeral reform, we think, suggests gray, with a crape band. Public opinion on this point has been much modified of late . years, and we personally think that in a climate like ours it is perfectly ridiculous to wear the heavy black clothing that has hitherto been the custom. . Damon (Hay). — Our opinion on the matter, which, how ever, is not a professional one, is that X is liable to prosecution for embezzlement if it can be proved that the money was paid in by Yto S's credit for a epecific purpose, and that X was cognisant of the fact. If only X and Y were aware of the agreement (which it- stated to have been a verbal one), there iB only tbe word of one ogainpt the other. The absence of a written specific agreement is, in our o^iniory of no very great momentif snffic ient evidence con be Brought to prove the verbal one. However, wa would advise votl to obtain a professional opinion on the subject before taking any action.

Kfkobene (Moree). — If the MAfwater got into your tin of kerosene it probably did not arix with it, but ran down the inside, and of course wouffl remain at the bottom with the oil above, and can b£ easily separated. The water will not mix with the oil unless the liquid is stirred, and then the oil is like globules in tne water. The compound is not at all dangerous, in fact it will not burn at all, but simply fizz if there is more than a small quantity of water in the mixture. When only a small quantity of kero sene is available, people sometimes half fill their lamps with water, and then fill up with kerosene, which will burn to the water, but no further. In doing this it is advisable to use a wick that only penetrates the oil, as beyond that it would be rendered useless by the water. When kerosene and water have got mixed, the best course to pursue is to pour the lot into a flat dish or vessel ; the oil will come to the top and can be poured .off. J. A. V. (Dora Creek).— Fulf instructions how to set a sundial were , given in the issue of the Sydney Mail of August 14, 1886 ; and as they are too long to reprint, we would suggest the advisability of our correspondent obtaining a copy of that date from the office. How ever, the following are the remarks of a scientific gentleman on the subject, which are inserted for the edification of all our readers : — Re Sundials : Tbe angles tor the lines on a dial depend upon the lati tude of the place, and must therefore be calculated fof each place, and some knowledge of trigono metrical calculation is required. People do not, as a rule, understand the principle of the dial, but think that a sundial once made is good anywhere ,' it has only to be set up level. Again, they have bo means of measuring the angles, when they are told what they are for each hour, and' they nave no means of setting the dial up true north and south. Setting np a sundial is an art not quite so easily acquired as many people think. I know, of 'course, that eundials are made in a rough and ready 3aehion, and are often an hour wrong in their indications, although the authors of them claim great accuracy — time direct from the sun, &c., &c. Subscriber (Queensland). — 1. In onr issue of 28th . December last year we quoted the following system atic plan of treatment for corpulency that was sent to the Medical Times. li was adopted by one who was constitutionally fat, and will clearly show that abstaining from bread and fermented liquors will remedy this inconvenience. We give the writer's own words: — ' Weighing 15£st. I reduced myself in three months to 12£st. by strictly adhering to the following plan of dieting* myself : Breakfast early, - , consisting of 2oz. of biscuits, one egg, two cups of tea or coffee; tben fasted until 5 o'clock, my dinner consisting of animal food, &c., but no bread, like wise avoiding bread at mv tea or supper. Abstain as ' much as possible from the use of nutter, sugar, and fat meat, and take plenty of exeroise every day.' By following the above course of procedure there seems to be no reason why it should not have a similar effect on yon. Messrs. Washington Soul and Co., druggists, of Pitt street, say that ' anti-fat' is very well known and reliable. If directions are followed good results ensue. They have it in stock, price 6s per bottle, full directions enclosed. 2. The ' Songs of Scot land' are transmitted post free— cloth 4s 6d, paper 3s— by Mr. Sandon, music-seller, 342, George-street.

The freedom of the city is a .charter of franchises granted by the King some 500 or 600 years ago to London and other cities which were worthy;— or wealthy enough to pay for — ' the establishment of a commune. Its advantages were 'that the chief officials could be elected by the burgesses, that the internal government and preserva , tion of law and order depended on the borough magistrates, and above all, that eveiy burgess was a , freeman, and could not be claimed by any lord or master, if he had resided within the borough one year and one day.' About the year 1319 every citizen .. was obliged, to enrol himself in one of the guilds ac cording to his trade, and those freemen who belonged ' to no trade iBought admission to a trade guild, and afterwards to a company, to obtain the freedom of the city. , We -presume that the privileges accruing to Mr. Parnell or any other one so* honoured would be the same as those that belong to any freeman of tbe city, whether free by birth or by acquisition. 2. Her Majesty'Queen Victoria was born on May 24, 1810 : succeeded her -uncle William IV., 'on June 20, 1837 ; was crowned on June 28, 1838; was married on Feb ruary 10, 1840, to his Boyal Highness . F. Albert A. C. E., Prince of Saxe Coburg and Gotha (Prince ? Consort), K.G., K.T., K.P., G.C.B., ? lv.S.I., G.C.M.G.. who was born August 26, 1819; and died December 14, 1861. ' The Queen's name is Alexan dria Victoria, and she is the only daughter and heir of tbe late Princc Edward, Duke of Kent. The family or sur-name is Guelph or Brunswick- Lunebourg. The record of the Prince Consort is as follows : — Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emanuel, Duke of Saxony; Prince of Saxe Cobourg and Gotha; second son of Ernest Duke of Saxe Cobourg and Gotha, by his first wife Dorothea Louisa, Princess of Saxe Gotha. 3. We do not think that 'Guelph' is a royal name. It would appear to have emanated from the Guelphs and Ghibeilines, the names of two great parties, the conflict of- which may te alniost 'Baid to make up the history of Italy and Germany from the 11th to the 14th century Flathead (Glen InneB).— To keep moths from : clothing : ' Put a few cuttings of Russia leather in . your trunk or wardrobe ; or sprinkle , a few pepper stones, pimento corns, or cloves, in the same places,' The following is also recommended : — Moths depoiit their eggs in the early spring. This, therefore, iB the time to put away furs and woollens for the summer. It is not lhe moth, but the maggot of the moth, that does the mischief with furs and woollens. To effectu ' ally preserve them from the ravages of these insects, thoroughly beat the furs with a thin rattan, and air. them for several hours; then carefully comb them with a clean comb, wrap them np in newspapers per fectly tight, and put them away in a thoroughly tight chest, .lined with tin or cedar wood. Take them out and examine them in the sun at least once a month, thoroughly beating them. This, indeed, is the. secret of the fur-dealers in preserving their stock. Camphor, which is much uBed to preserve furs, impairs their beauty by turning them light. The printing-ink on the newspapers is juBt as effectual as camphor, being very distasteful to the moth. The above method may elft- be adopted to preserve feathers and all kinds of woollen clothing, omitting, of -course, the combing. Camphor may be sprinkled among the woollms. To polish cedar : To I pint of spirits of wine add joz. of gum copal, Joz. of gum arabic, and loz. fhellac. Let your guma be well bruised and sifted through a piece of muslin. Put the spirits and the gums in a vessel that can be closely corked ; place them near a warm stove and frequently shake them. In two or three days they will be di6 : . ? , - . - ? 'solved. Strain it through a piece of muslin, audi keep it well-corked for use. All polishes are used much in the same way. If your work be porous, or the grain coarse, it will be necessapr, previous to poifsMng, to give it a coat of clean size previous to fvttr eomsMticing with the polish; and when dry go* over if gently with very fine glass-paper. The size: will fill up the pores and prevent the waste of the polish, by being' absorbed into tbe wood, and be also* a saving of considerable time in the operation. Our issue of December 7 last gives the method, A:c., of. French polishing. A. M. W. (Yanga). — To stew cucumbers. Time, five or six minutes to fry, six or seven to stew : 'An equal ' quantity of cucumbers and onions, '2oz. butter,' three tablespoonfuls of frravv, two tablespoonfuls of white ? wine, and half a blade of maco, a little salt audi cayenne, a piece of butter rolled in flour. Cut into ? slices an equal quantity of cucumbers and onions, andi fry them in 2oz. of butter. Strain them from the. butter and put them into a stewpan with the gravy, , wine, and mace. Set it over a slow tire and let it stew ? for about six or seven minutes; then stir in a piece of butter rolled in flour, a seasoning of salt, and a very little cayenne. Shake it over the fire until the sauce thickens, and then serve it up hot.' To stuff and stew cucumbers. Time, one hour and five minutes : 'Two- large cucumbers, a little forcemeat, three-quarter, pint of stock, 2oz. of butter, a bunch of sweet herbs. Peel two large cucumbers ; cut a piece off the large end and scoop out -the seeds ; fill it with forcemeat,, replace the piece from the end, and secure it with a very small skewer. Put about a pint of gravy into a stewpan with 2oz. of good butter and a bunch of sweet, herbs. Put in the cucumbers, set the pan over a mode rate fire, and let them stew very slowly for one hour Then take them out, and boil down the sauce for a. few minutes, pour it over the cucumbers, and serve hot.' To roast cucumbers. Time, 20 minutes or halt an hour: 'Two large cucumbers, some forcemeat, a little butter, half a pint of gravy. Boil two large: cucumbers for about 10 or 12 minutes, then cut thenii down, and take out all tbe inside. Fill them with forcemeat, and tie them neatly together, dredge over them a little flour, and place them before a bright, fire in a Dutch oven to become brown, basting thenv frequently with fresh butter. When done, put them on a hot dish, remove the string carefully that they shall not come apart, and serve them up with a little rich gravy poured, round them.' To dress cucum bers: ' Five tabiespoonfuls of vinegar, three of salad, oil, pepper and salt. Pare the cucumberSj and com mence cutting them at the thick end with a sharp, knife or a cucumber cutter ; shred them as thin_ as- possible on a dish, sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and pour over them tbei above proportion of oil and vinegar.' Cucumbers, a la Poulette. Time, 25 minutes : ' Three large cucumbers, a little 6alt, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, yolk of two eggs, a piece of butter, a little flour, two spoonfuls of cream, and half a pint of broth. 'J ake three large cucumbers, pare off the rind, and cut them into slices: of an equal thickness. Pick out the seeds and boil them tender in boiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt and a table spoonful of vinegar. When done, take them carefully out with a slice, and when drained put them into a .stewpan with half a pint of broth, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and two spoonfuls of cream. Skim off any fat which may rise, and boil it gently for a quarter of an hour, taking care that the slices of cucumber are not broken.

[BY HENWIFE.] Before bcgiuniiig my notes for this month I wish to refer agsiu to thc peculiarity noticed in oggB during the very hot weather wc had in January. I have received a great many letters on the subject, and apparently the phenomenon-I can call it nothing else-has extended through thc district, as it has been noticed ut Barcaldine, Aramac, and even further out. I cannot understand or account for it, nor eau I find anything at all like it mentioned in any of my books of leference. Of two eggs I received and broke, tkougli not actually mixed with tho white, tho yolk slipped from its skin directly it touched tito basin. One correspondent tells me nearly all her eggs were affected for about a week. I am completely mystified. Several correspon- dents have suggested reasons, the chief being that the hens lad eaten ergot weed ; but had they done so it would not affect the egg in that way, though it would cause them to slip their eggs before thc shell covered them-what ie called abortion. Nothing the hen cats can affect her egg once it has passed into the oviduct. As I mentioned some months back in my notes, thc oviduct is the egg passage through which the yolk posses, gathering the white, layer by layer, till it reaches n certain stage, and is ready for the skin envelope, which also consists of two layers. Lastly it is coaled with the sholl, and all this takes place while passing through the oviduct. It sometimes happens that two yolks slip into the oviduct at once, and going on their way together become enveloped in the white, which is a secretion of the oviduct, and finally, being clothed in the one shell, come to us as douhle-yolked eggs. Any of my readers, who arc of an enquiring turn of mind, can better understand the formation of thc egg by boiling one very bard, and then carefully taking it to pieces-first the shell, then the two layers of skin, then the white, layer after layer, till the yolk is reached. The oviduct is about two feet long, so, as I say, what the hen eats after her egg once enters it, would not affect it. lu most yards moulting should bc over by thc beginning of this month. At the same time, this has been such an extraordinary season, I am afraid to state any poultry fact positively. My own fowls arc not through their moult yet; hut will bc in ten days or so. Unless wc soon get tine weather, the laying season will also be later than usual. By the last week in March batching should bc begun. I have heard of Bevcral yards where it has been in progress since early in February, and where most of the chickens have already gone the way of all flesh. The late wet weather should bc a warniug to all those poultry breeders in future, lt is never safe to begin hatching in this district before the 15th of March. This advice does not apply where artificial incubators and foster mothers are in nee. We can generally depend upon getting some sort of wet season during thc first three months of the year, and it is too hot for thc hens to Bit, and too wet for the chickens when hatched to do much good, even if they survive. The fowls require a little extra foeding this weather, particularly those vnrietiel that do not hunt afield much. I have been greatly amused watching my own game birds since the bad weather began. Ko amount of rain keeps them from thc paddock. There are thousand« of tiny frogs in the grass, and these the younger fowls almoBt live entirely on, even during the heaviest showers they are to be seen away down by thc river, and not one night have they roosted anywhere but in their usual place, viz., the branches of a poinciana tree. The older birds arc wiser and seek shelter from thc wet. I would advise a very generous morning meal for the whole yard, until they have recovered from the effects of the Ute bad weather, and for thc purpose of iuducing egg production. Pollard and oatmeal mixed or maize meal and pollard, with a few spoonfuls of black pepper, is a good combination for a first feed. Corn will bc very dear for some time to come, but oats or wheat are just as good, save and except in very cold, weather. Oats must bo soaked overnight, or they may cause packing in thc crops. Mest scraps will bc good for thc laying liens just now, nnd all bones should bc charred in the fire, and then broken up with a stout hammer. Hens are as fond of bones as the dogs arc. In my lost mouth's notes I spoke of the "" Mack Wyandotte."" I am now in corre- spondence with a southern poultry breeder, who has Black Minorcas, an excellent breed for this climate, I know from experience, having bad them at one time. They ure larger than Spanish, and very like them in some points, but without the white face. So far as I can remember they are non-sitters. I do not know whether it was from the Chinese we got the recipe for preserving eggs in lime, but it ie a fact that they preserve eggs in a Bolation of wood ashes, lime, and salt, mixed with water in which some aromatic plant has been boiled. This paste is run into a wooden tub, and the eggs taken fresh from the nests are embedded in it in layers. Then the tub is hermetically sealed, and at the end of six weeks the eggs are considered fit for uso, but at thc end of forty years they arc considered better. For every day use, eggs arc steeped in salt water mixed with soot or red clay, in which they arc baked when required. A plain lightly boiled egg is never seen in China, they are always hard boiled, and the older they are thc better. In one part of the country the greatest delicacy is unhatched duck roasted. The eggs ure taken from the hatching-house twelve hours before hatching, placed in a hot oven and baked, then they ure sold from door to door. Strange lo say, the blacks of this country also follow this custom. I have known them watch a nest of wild duck eggs for days and days till ready. A correspondent asks the quantity of lime to UBC for preserving eggs.' Take one pint af lime to each gallon of water, stir, and boil fifteen minutes. Let stand till clear sud pour off the water, boil up the lime ugaiu with half the previous quantity of water, and when clear add to thc first lot. Put the eggs in be- fore they arc six hours old. The above is the recipe I have used for years, A correspondent in this district writes to ask, are pumpkin seeds injurious to poultry T This is a question repeatedly asked me, so for thc benefit of my many readers I reply to it herc. Yes, moBt certainly pumpkin seeds are injurious, and particularly so tn laying hens, causing diarrhoea, and reducing egg pro- duction. I am nat a believer in pumpkins as a food for thc fowls very often. I remember anco in the Maryborough dis- trict, heine asked to look at some fowls that had fallen away in a moat unaccountable manner. It had been a terribly wet season, and thu -owner of the fonds seeing that grain food was very dear, had bought a ton of pumpkins, unit during thc wet days fed ex- clusively on mashed pumpkin, with the result that his hons stopped laying and fell away to skin and hone. If any of my readers know anything about thc effects of Karma on poultry I would bc very glad to hear from them. One correspondant writes me that some of bis hens were affected in inuoh the same manner as thc cows. And another tells me he lisa <eacn «he liens fed on the refuse of the plant after the fibre, or whatever it is, has been taken for pillows and beds, without any bad result*. It ia a matter of which I know nothing at all, therefore will be most grateful for information from thoao who have ex- perience of it. I must ask those correspondents who wish their queries replied to in Poultry Kotes to let me have them by the 15th of thc month. To those who enclose a stamped en- velope it does not matter, as I can reply to them any time. Sometimes it will pay to wait in thc hope of getting better prices, hut as a rule it is best to sell when thc crop is ready for market. The man who supplies the home market is usually able to put in his own pocket a considerable percentage of the cost of trans- portation when crops are sent to distant places. A poor cow with a long pedigree is not worth as much as a good cow without any other recommendation than the milk pail. Thc milk-pail certifícate is the one that it pays best to go by. Few farmers have figured out how much they have lost by feeding live stock beyond the point where feeding is a paying opera- tion. A vast amount of money hus ucen wasted in this way. A pig that loses ground during the first three months of its life will seldom make a satisfactory feeder. Thc start it gets im- mediately after birth has everything to do with its Bucccss later on, and with the profit that accrues to the owner. Owing to what arc described as the ruinous rates paid to butchers, many of thc farmers of North Wales arc killing their own Block, and retailing the meat at from 5d. to 7d. per lb. It takes u certain quantity of food to keep a cow alive. Above ihut, what she eats goes to make milk or flesh. Thc ODO lb. cow, os a rule, pays better than one that weighs 14001b. Entering a certain store. Pat says : ""Do ye kape butter here ?"" Irish storekeeper : ""Kape butter, ye greenhorn? I've kept butter this twenty yeats."" Pat: ""Well,) kape it, then. It's too ould for me."" The result of thc milk-testing in connection with the Berry Show was UB follows :-Mr. J. Lindsay's cow Honeycomb, in three milk ings, gave 124$lb. of milk; Mr. R. N. Boyd's cow, 911b.; Mr. D. Hyam's cow, 80Mb. In feeding "" separator "" milk to calves and pigs, it has been discovered, after numerous experiments st the Vermont Agricultural College in America, that it agrees better with the digestive organs of the animals to let it cool, and even become ""eloppcred,"" before use. This seems contrary to reason, but it is supposed that the lactic ferment thus gene- rated helps to digest the milk in the stomachs of the calves and pigs. Farmers should, try the question with half-a-dozen animals fed with thc new warm milk from the separator, and six with skim milk that has been allowed to coo), or even to become sour. Meal aud bran should be fed equally to both sets if pigs aro experimented with, so that the question shall bo fairly decided upon ita merits. If other food is added for calves treat both lots alike._",poultry note march henwife bcgiuniiig note month wish refer agsiu thc peculiarity notice oggb hot weather wc january receive great letter

POULTRY NOTES FOR MAY. | (ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.),2,"AGRICULTURAL KEWS. I POULTRY JfOTBS FOR MA Y. [By aEKurrrtJ (ALL BIGHTS RESERVED.) Tba lat« severe weather bas again reduced tho egg record. The hens will not Jay during long continued wet or severe weather of oqy kind, be it heat, cold, or rain. Ho better proof could be furnished ts show that poultry must be thoroughly comfortable! and at ease, to do well. During a discussion on this sub- ject, thc other day, it was said, ""But if a hen hos started to lay, ber eggs are there, and they will be laid, no matter what tba weather."" This is on idea held by a great many people, and it is wrong. The hen will lay those eggs already matured, or ready to fiasa into the oviduct, but if her general icaltli and comfort bo thrown out of gear by disturbing causes, such as woollier, fright, swore pain, or sickness of any kind, thc oilier eggs will die away and be absorbed into the system in some way or other. If such causes arc removed within « certuiu time suuie of her eggs may recover, and eventually come to maturity. With some hens baa weather makes no difference in their laying ; but in a largo yard there is always a noticeable reduction in the eggs col- lected. Some hens will lay two, three, and perhaps four eggs before beiug affected ; othens I have known to stop Bhort. When a hen has stolen ber nest, and if she has a fair number of eggs, she will at once sot herself if bad weather conies on. If is a very Btrange thing, hens that steal their nesta ucver lay more eggs than they can comfortably cover. I oin convinced instinct teaches I lieu) bow to regulate these mutters when it becomes necessary. Twice when I have killed hens found Bitting away iu the grasa, I have found the remains of more eggs faded and dwindled ; in the ordinary way. A hen lays about two clutches, or from twenty-two to twenty five eggs her first laying ; therefore when she steals her nest she destroys nearly or quite half. It ÍB quite possible the fact of setting, and the reduced quantity of food ebo takes, may have ' thc effect of killing the immature eggs, but I cannot think BO, know- ing their great intelligence in other mutters. I incline to the belief she knowingly arranges the matter, perhaps by the aid of «onie herb. Thc fowl house should be looked to this month, and repaired where necessary ; it always pays to make the fowls comfortable. Too many of the fowl houses in this district are mere muke-siiifts, old outhouses with a roost or two put up. Some broken down old shed filled with timber, os which the fowls arc allowed to roost, and in which the droppings accumulate for years, is made to suffice. This is often thc state of things on really prosperous farms. The poultry are only suffered as sort of scavengers, or make-weights. A week or two ago, I was taken out to have a look at a Sock of sick turkeys. There were no leBS than twenty eight of them, half-grown birds too, and all very nearly bloodless from lice. It was a clear case of big lice, little lice, black lice, white lice, and every other sort of lice imagin- able. Kat only were they on the skin, out thíy were also under it in little cists or cells. Most people have heard of what is called "" The Duke of Portland's disease,"" and which scourge was the means of banishing one of the most promising of England's youngest statesmen for ever from public life and view. This was clearly what the turkeys were Buffering from. The lice bad swarmed more heavily than usual a few days before my visit, the larger kind fmm under the skin being the strongor, and they were simply eating the birds, feathers, flesh, and all. There was no cure. No amount of fumi- gating would have cleared them, the only thing was execution. I may say I never paw such a ose before,, and I never before saw turkeys badly infested With vermin. Bot i hardly wondered when I saw the roosting filace of these unhappy birds. It was an oin ean-to against a pig Btye, and to put it mildly, there was quite six years' droppings accumulated in it To those about to build, or who can afford to build new fowl bouses, let me suggest the advisability of their being made of wire wherever possible, and with shutters of irou or wood, hinged under the eaves to be let down in the winter. A closed np house is only required in this climate for about three months in the year. So that it is only right that they should be bnilt more with a view to summer accommodation thnu winter. And if boarded up for two or three feet from thc ground, then wire netting to the roof, the house will answer all purposes as regards summer. If the Bhutters are attached,' they can be msde to form a verandah during hot weather, and to close the house in during wet or cold. The ideal poultry houses are those patented by au American firm, and are port- able, and so can be moved on to fresh ground every few weeks. But whatever the houses are built of, let it be with a view to giving vermin no foothold, no cracks to breed in. Many people are surprised at the rapidity with which vermin increase and multiply, but considering they mature and reproduce themselves in hundreds every twenty-four hours, it is not so wonderful. .Never confine the young chickens in damp coops or they will get cramp. The season for roup is approaching, so look to the young etock ; prevention is better tbau cure, lt begins with a bad cold, feverishness, wasting, ana an offensive discharge from the nostrils and eyes, which, if not. attended to, may collect and form a thick cheesy mass. Roup is occasionally mistaken for warts or chicken pox, but only by the inexperienced. Where people have a garden, and also keep fowls, they should utilise every scrap of ben manure. When the fowl house is cleaned out, tho manure should be put in a heap mixed with earth, in the proportions of three spades of earth to one of droppings. Let it be under'cover if possible, or if not, placea sheet of iron or bark over it to prevent washing away. Sweepings from the house, &c., can be added ; anything iu fact, even feathers, broken egg shelis, old nests, kc It must bc kept moist ; and if there is au unpleasant smell from it, it is easily sup- pressed by a liberal sprinkling with copperas water, or a fresh addition of dry earth to the top or outside. Hen manure, and the refuse of the poultry house preserved in this way, will in a few months become one of thc best fertilizers for either field or garden. It is bcBt not to have the heap too big, but rather to start a fresh one when the first has reached a convenient size. It is well to have a stick, an inch or so in diameter, run into the heap to judge now und then its heat, aud when it seems to bc gettiug too hot, shovel it over again and repack. I have several times been asked, at what age do pullets lay ? Much depends upon the circumstances, thc breed, time of year when hatched, and how fad und cared for. The larger the breed, the longer thc pullets are in earning to maturity. Then, if forced in growth, as is often done with incubator chicks, they frequently begin to lay earlier by a mouth or two than they would otherwise ; but so far us my iiicmory.gervce me, thc average periods of age at which pullets begin to lay arc : Brahmas and CochiiiB, niue monthB ; Lang- enaus, Wyundottes, Rocks, Dorkings, and Javas, eight months; Hamburgs, Leghorns, Minóreos, and game, MI months. These are the ages given by good authorities, but under merely ordinary attention, not forced. I saw by one of Hie late papers that a consignment of eggs hud reached England from the colonies pucked, after oiling, in bran, pollard, and suit, and that they were all very good. I never before heard of sucfi a mode of pre- serving eggs, and should certainly have liked to tesl those cugs myself. I have tried very many modes of preserving them myself, and have never found any to equi! tile limo water. I once was voi-y successful with another way, but only guve it thc one trial. It is a Chinese rcccipc and is as follows:-Take flowers of sulphur and suiliciont lamp black to hide the colour, put into a Bardine tain, and set ia.ons comer of a large Un lined cate. . Place a basket of eggs also in the case. Set the sulphur und lamp black alight, cover the case tightly and lat vc it so for twelve hoars. I dc? not know why this should preservo the eggs, but it certainly did preserve thuBO experi- mented on, for three moutliB any way. i will try it egain mme day and let my readers know the reso.lt, bnt, in the meantime, I would advise the old lime water recipe in: preference to bran, pollard, and salt. Ifindin reading over these notes, I have said ' nothingaboutthetreatmentof roupifperebanoe it should break «ut. I rather expect ¡if after all' the rain we have bad. In the first instance, ] when it is but as cold, put a few drops of kerosene in thc drinking water ; but directly I more advanced symptoms appear, isolate the affected hirds and put them into a warm dry coop, and give a small spoonful of castor oil ofter well washing the eyes and nostrils with warm soda water and carbolic soap. If there is much discharge thc washing may have to be done several times a day, but without the soap if possible. Every two days repeat the castor oil, but only iu Binall doses, BÍX drops for a Bmull bird, ten or twelve for a large. I am aware that, calomel is largely uacd in cases of roup by experienced fanciers, butpcrsonally I have been most successful with the oil, the birds making a good and quick recovery, while after being treated with calomel they wera subject to a relapse, and particularly sensitive to cold for a long time. I have lost a number of good birds under the lutter treaUncut, but only two under thc former, and both »ere bad oases, and brought to me as a last resource. Thc feeding during roup is of the utmost importance, as there is great wasting and greater weakness. It is the only disease where I have used stimulants, and in bad cases I give from throe to six- drops of whiskey in a spoonful of water three rimes a day. Feed ou bread and milk, oatmeal, maizeineal, raw egg, cow heel, anything and everything that is nourishing. A lemon ceases to develop size after it starts to colour up, so that every lemon that shotts tho yellow should be picked for curing. But lemons should not be picked at au! They should be carefully clipped from thc tree, retaining about a quarter of au inch of stem l/> each fruit A lemon-grower, when be goes out to harvest his fruit, should imagine that he is about to handle eggs. Lemons require to be handled just as carefully ns hen-fruit. In warm weather hutter keeps cool and sweet if the jars containing it are plunged to the neck into an air-tight box that has wet sand fitting closely around the butter jars. Keep thc sand wet with plenty of cool water ; a biscuit tin is quite large enough to hold the necessary jar. Mr. L. Grizzi, of Huntly, near Bendigo, claims to possess the largest grape vine in Victoria. The branches of the vine cover un area of thirty-five square yards, and the stein is 10 iu. thick in diameter. Tile grapes from this vine this year weighed two and a half tons, and produced six hogsheads of wine. A member of a firm of provision merchants in Glasgow, who is now visiting Australia, recommends that dairymen, instead of killing their calves, should fatten them on separated milk and send them to Englaud as frozen veal. He estimates that the fattening process would occupy about six weeks, and the calves on arrival in England would be worth on an average £6 10s. each. The farmers ia the vicinity of Woco Creek, North Isis (states thc Bmdabtrg Mall) have BO far succeeded in their effort« to obtain a mill under thc Sugar Works Guarantee Act that (he pipers are now in the hands of a lawyer for the purpose of registration. The company will be known as the Isis Central Mill Company, Limited, with a capital of £25.000. Over 2000 acres vi land will be given ss security. It is proposed to have the mill erected by 1890, when 700 acres af cane will be available. To clamour for cheaper freights in order to make dai.-ying pay is scarcely so wise as get- ting _ more butter from each cow. Every farmer can by selection acquire a dairy hera thar yields over 600 gallons of milk per cow annually. By good feeding he can get milk of RU8taiucd richness, and by utilising the skim milk to the best advantage a profit may be made out of a waste product. The truest economy is to produce thc most at the least cost. One shilling per pound may be the present price in London, but every thing points to 9J. as being the future standard. Thc Victorian bonus of £6 per ton led to an export of 220 tons of cheese last season. Numbers ol butter factories are now fitting up cheese plants on the Canadian Cheddar system. Mr. David Wilson points out that it i« imperative to Bend nothing but the best uniform quality. Victoria has the pastures und the milk, bnt needs the skill to make cheese for the British palate ; wherefore ex- perts should be engaged to sbow how. In I860 Canada exported under 1,000,0001b. of cheese, in 1870 near 6,000,0001b., in 1880 40,000,000lb., iu 1890 94,0^0,000lb., audio 1891 106,00001b. Thc New South 'Wales Department of Agri- culture has received the following report upon the cowpea, a fodder plant introduced by tho departmeut some three years ago : "" I regard it as the most valuable plant that, has been introduced, both for manurial and general purposes. Horses can work on less corn w hen fed with it, and cows are fond of it, though I am unable to sneak of its tullk pmducing qualities. Figs thrive on it. In 1892 two-thirds of a three-acre field were planted with cowpea, the remaining one third, the middle strip with impbee. In Februsry, IS93, the Doods destroyed both peas and imphee. In September last the cowpea portion having been ploughed thrice and the imphee part four times, the land was planted with cane, and I have no hesitation io saving that to day there is lour times the crop on the pea land than on the imphee. In every place where peas have grown there is a marked improvement on the following crop. "" Recently Mr. E. G. Preece, of Shrewsbury, shipped from Liverpool to Alexandria a small consignment of pedigree Shropshire and Hampshire DownB rame for the Aboukir Company, who own 32,000 acres of very fertile land near to Alexandria. It ia pro- posed to cross the rams with the native sheep in order to improve their mutton, as the latter are notoriously bad, and almoct unfit for consumption. Should thc experiment answer a large shipment ia to follow, in eluding some ewes, in order to enable tin company to breed their own stock rams oui there, and thus avoid the expense of im- porting them from England.- This district affords a good openiug for young and ener get io British farmers, as thu climate is very good, the soil wonderfully fertile, laboui exceedingly cheap, and a capital market (Alexandria) close at hind. The land can bc irrigated from the numerous canalB, especial 1\ the Mahomoudcsh Canal, which runs through thc property. At a recent meeting of Ure stock salesmen and others held at Inverness, the subject ol tuberculosis came up for consideration. After due discussion the following resolution was unanimously adopted, and it was resolved to forward it lo thc Boord of Agriculture and certain members of Parliament :-""That this meeting is of opinion that tuberculosis in cattle has become so prevalent as tc scrioutly affect thc food supply of thc country, ami resolves to urge upon thc Government the necessity of giving compen- sation out of public funds for cattle compul- sorily slauchtcrcd, und also for carcases condemned by thc inspectors as being affected with tuberculosis."" A return was lately issued showing tho number of carcases seized during the year ending March, 1803, by medical officers of health and in* specters of nuisances in England and Wales, and of the number of such carcases con. dcinncd by justices, ilistinguiehiug os fur us practicable t!ie number so condemned in con- sequence of the animal having suffered from tuberculosis. Altogether 8822 were seized during thc year, 382 hy metropolitan sanitary authorities, 2770 by town connells of county boroughs, 124 by town oounoils of other boroughs, twenty-two by local boards, and fifteen by rural sanitary authorities.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ASKED BY CORRESPONDENTS,2,"ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ASKED BY CORRESPONDENTS | M.T.M. (Wellington, N.Z.).—This is probably the re- } cipe you are asking for:—To get rid of fleas in ken nels, give them as little harborage as possible, by keeping the place thoroughly clean. Insecticides, even if they kill the fleas at the time of application, do not prevent a fresh colony arriving from elsewhere. To keep them out, scatter pennyroyal about the floor, or, if the herb is not obtainable, take 2oz. tincture of pennyroyal, 2oz. oil of sassafras, and 4oz. spirits of wine, mix thoroughly in a bottle, and spray the place with it from time to time. Washing the floor thoroughly with phenyl and water—milk white—thrice a week will gene rally cause fleas to disappear and remain absent, but after a time the dog will bring them again. Power (Canowinora).—Brevity is commendable, of course, but your query is too terse for us to gather what you want. Be a little more explicit. F.C. (Carlton, Vic.).—You know the old proverb con cerning when doctors differ, etc.? The universally-re ceived idea ha9 been that high heels are injurious to the girl who wears them. The authority you quote says so, too, but argues that ""very"" high heels are not, and ""are often beneficial to some women."" Well, you see, as be does not specify what kind of women Ms advice is not much of a guide, and he is in a minority as yet, anyway. Inquirer (Subiaco).—A man of €0, requiring a climate of from 65 to 80 degrees, and requiring fishing as a re creation, ought to get all he wants in the neighborhood of Sydney. Dunbar (Perth).—You persist in using the foolish pen-name we object to, and we have omitted it. If you are so positive on the matter, why ask us? We repeat that the name of the vessel was the Dunbar. The Duncan Dunbar was wrecked at Las Rocas, South Ame rica, on October 7, 1865. No lives were lost. As to the other vessels, we have no information, hut will try and get it for you. Cards (Macleay).—Cannot answer queries by poet The article on cartomancy appeared in ""The World's News"" of September 5, 1908. If you wish for a copy, write to tbe Manager, King-street, Sydney, and in addition to the price enclose Id for each month for storage—that is to say in this case, Is—and a copy will be posted to you. Industrious (Granville).—Can only advise you to per severe. With your credentials you will be sure of get ting something suitable some day. A.R. (Bathurst).—Answered half a dozen times al ready. A mile square is necessarily a square mile, but a square mile need not be a mile square, or a square at all. A mile square is a square area, each side of which measures one mile. This contains, of course, <40 acres. Well, any 640 acres, oblong, triangular, round, or many sided, would be a square mile also, bet not a mile square, of courae. G.S. (Summer-hill).—There is no real ""remedy"" for moles except an operation. Moles are of what is called developmental origin, and, besides being very disfiguring, sometimes have malignant growths spring from them in later life. It is better to have the piece of skin on which they are cut clean away than to try and eradicate them by caustics, but, of course, the operation must be performed by a qualified medical man. Sufferer (Araluen).—The remedy for insomnia you al lude to was simply to resolve firmly to keep awake. But we cannot recommend it -as of universal application. L.H.W. (CofFs Harbor).—We answer this question every month or so, and have frequently explained the matter fully. He is looking at the portrait of his son. X.Y.Z. (Burrangong).—Your stockman's lament is good in idea, and worth rewriting after you have learned a little of the meaning of rhythm and can manage to arrange lines that scan. At present you cannot, sad some good ideas are spoiled. One can quite under stand your old stockman who laments that— Where once we rode on the open plain And over the ridges steep, 'Tis now all fences and golden grain With hardly a sign of a sheep. He mourns the spacious days of un fenced runs and Wide-spread holdings, and the wild, free doings of the olden time. It is, as you say, an old song—one sung by pioneers everywhere when they are moved on by progress and population. And it is no use moralising over the thing, or for that matter finding fault with the real sentiment of men. who, like your stockman, find they are ""out of the field."" He winds up his lament with a bit of sound philosophy— So Fll roll my swag and fly; I'll leave them to their fate, But I'll heave a sigh for the days gone by As 1 pass the homestead gate. I'll face the westward ever, Strike out for the setting sun; May be in the far-cut Never, I'll find an old-time run. We have not selected any of tbe very badly scanning lines for quotation, but you will easily know which we mean. It might be worth your while to polish up and alter, and this could not be said if there were not some merit in your work. E.W.A. (Boonah, <$.).—1. A good mixture to prevent the hair tailing out is made by taking 2oz. glycerine, 2oz. tincture of capsicum, and ldr. oil of bergamot. Mix well, and use regularly, avoiding all other pomades, etc. Wash the hair occasionally with soft water and fine soap. 2. Excessive moistness of the hair is not 60 common as the reverse condition, and, unless excessive, the moisture is not a bad thing. If it is, try the follow ing drying wash daily:—Powdered bicarbonate of soda, %oz.; powdered biborate of soda, %oz.; eau-de-cologne, 1 fluid ounce; rectified spirit, 2 fluid ounces; tincture of cochineal, one-eighth of a fluid ounce; distilled water, 16 oz. W.W. (Parramatta).—The question asked was whether oysters could be kept just as opened from the shell for a week, and we are of opinion they could not. But the Chinese have a way of partly drying them which would answer. Directly the oysters are taken from the shells plunge into boiling water for a moment. Then expose to the sun until all moisture is gone. Only the fattest should be treated, and they will retain their full flavor and keep fresh for a long time if put in a cool, dry place. B.S.J. (Bulli).—The average quantity of water re quired by a cow daily is eight gallons. The milk given is about 87 per cent, of water. When there is no water in the paddock the cows are supplied night and morn ing, which forces each cow to drink four gallons at a time in order to be supplied. . The cow may use less and will reduce her milk supply accordingly. Poor feed or an excess of water will decrease the quality of the milk and lessen the proportion of butter tat, which means of course there will he less cream. C.L.D. (Sidney).—The old way to make birdlime is to take the middle bark of the holly, gathered in mid summer, and boil it for six to eight hours in water, or till it becomes tender. Then drain off the water and place the bark in a pit, surrounded by stones, be tween layers of fern, and covered with earth. Leave it to foment for two or three weeks, till it forms a sort of mucilage, which must be first pounded in a mortar, and afterwards rubbed between the hands in running water till all refuse is washed out. Then put it in an earthen vessel, and let it remain for four or five days to purify itself. Other bark and vegetable substances may be used in the same way, but are not so good. If any sticks to the bands remove it with turpentine. A simpler method which an swers very well is as follows: Boil half a pint of linseed oil in an iron vessel over a slow fire, stirring occasionally with a stick until done. To test it, plunge the stirring-stick into cold water, and try it with the fingers. When done enough, pour it into pots, cover them close, and set them in a cool place. It should be boiled in the open air, on account of its bad smell. If the lime happens to be too stiff, it may be thinned with a little Stockholm tar. M.J.R. (Port Douglas).—Itching, such as you describe, may arise from eczema, or from the presence of some parasite, but dyspepsia and diabetes often cause an itching which is then symptomatic. If you are sure your general health is right, and the trouble is local, bathe frequently with warm water, drying carefully afterwards, and sponge with carbolic lotion (1 in 40); menthol and olive oil (1 in 5) is also a good applica tion, painted on with a brush. A good simple remedy which often succeeds is ""cigar tea."" Soak a cigar in a pint of hot water till the juice is pretty well drawn out of it, and sponge it on the part affected. But—if you are not sure about bodily health—see a doctor. B.C. (Mitchell, Q.).—If your chimney does not require sweeping the fact that it smokes is due to some fault in its construction. A narrow throat passing) backward from the place where ignition goes on is the necessary condition. Too much room for the smoke to pass is the cause of the trouble in most cases, causing rival currents of air. where there should be only one. Novice (Lithgow).—Your idea seems to be to repro duce the- ideas of an ignorant old conservative of the back-blocks, who thinks everything new and startling he sees in print is a lie, and who, at some length, criticises the most recent announcements of mechanical scienti fic discovery. But you hardly make this clear enough —you introduce him too abruptly, and shut him off too suddenly. He starts off most unnaturally and un realistically, by saying— I'm a farmer of much knowin', As Til %oon be after sbowin', And I don't believe half that I haws seen In that paper over they-er, That they call the penny liar Although some people think I'm mitey green. Some people will think you are if you write lines like the third, and fancy it verse. And to have to misspell a word for a rhyme and then miss it is a blunder as well as a crime against poetic good taste. He goes on to say— With lies I am familiar, • But such giants aa these would kill jet If you swallowed them they never would digest, and so on. This is badly mixed, and we spare much more which follows; and leave it in merciful non existence. Even admitting or forgiving everything else, the humor is very forced, and the subject not handled with skill. You have not the gift of working out the idea, though you seem to be able to discover the ma terial. Get someone else to write your next Old Miner (Maroo River).—You do not give us much information about your eyes, but we gather that you are troubled with specks, apparently, before the eyes, anj a dimness or cloudiness of vision. At 73 you must ex pect the eyes to show signs of wear, and these are of them. You do not say if you wear glasses; if not, a properly-fitted pair would probably help you a great deal. You are probably suffering from a strain on the eyes that glasses would prevent. There is no prescrip tion that we can give that will cure the trouble; tut if the eyes or surrounding parts are inflamed at all batlie freely night and morning with boracie acid lotion, made by dissolving an ounce of the acid in an ordinary (re puted) quart bottle, which, of course, holds about a pint and a half. Navua (Fiji).—Talc is not ""made"" in the sense you appear to think. It is a mineral rarely found crystallised, usually massive and then _ foliated, sometimes globular, sometimes granular. It ii composed mainly of silica, magnesia, and water. The purest occurs in flakes with a greasy feel, and of a light green, or greenish white, color. Its name i9 nearly the same in various European languages, and is from the same root as tallow, from its greaeiness. J.& (Paddington).—Mr. W. E. Gladstone—the G.O.M. —died on May 19, 1894. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, both Houses of Parliament attending his fune ral. Wagner (Ascot Yale, Vic.).—The violoncello is not considered a very difficult instrument. Having a good knowledge of music you could teach yourself to ""play simple melodies,"" and more, without a master. Trixie (Tarana).—The hymn containing the words yon quote is the old Evening Hymn, commencing ""Glory to Thee, my God, this night."" It is found in the hyma books of almost every Protestant denomination. W.B. (Gowra).—Will try and get for you. R.T.T. (Clarence).—For particulars about service in Papua, write to the Commonwealth Offices, Sydney. For the Straits Settlements it would be better to writs direct. M.M. (North Sydney).—To clean white fur, lay it on a table and rub well with bran moistened with warm water. When rubbed dry, rub with dry bran. Bub against the way of the fur, with flannel for the wet bran, and book muslin for the dry. After finishing with the bran, rub with magnesia. Dry flour may be used in place of the wet bran. E.M. (Enmore).—To cure wallaby and other skins with out tanning, spread them with the fur down, and sprinkle thickly with a mixture of two parts saltpetre, ere part salt, and one part alum, pounded together. Boll up for a few days, and then spread over a board, and scrape till free from flesh, etc. Keep them stretch ed; rub with neatsfoot oil, and expose to the sun for a couple of days. Then scrape again, and rub very hot whiting in with a flannel. When dry and well brushed, the skins are ready for use. Another way is called the alum process, and is even simpler. Tack the skins on a board, fur side down, and wash over with strong brine. Then make a strong solution of alum and milk—say, 3or. to a pint—and sponge with this daily for a week. let the skins dry, and then remove from board, rolling first ene way and then another, till quite pliable. Shamrock (Terang).—Do not care to criticise pub lished poetry. May say in passing, however, that the feet that it requires manuscript marginal notes de stroys its chance of a gold medal at once. G.B. (Sydney).—See answer to Shamrock. Also note that we do not venture to express any opinion on modern prophets and their predictions. We wait and see if they come off. J.K. (Paddington).—Sketch not what we require, thanks. We do not criticise prose contributions in de tail. Want of space. A.C. (Croydon, Q.).—Address published last week. Chne-cutter (Goodwood).—1. If a ""perfect mould"" were taken of a gramophone record and perfect records moulded from it they would play the same tunes as th« original. But the job would not be one for an amateur. 2. If you mean them to travel at the same rate the man with the smaller wheel would have to pedal faster, of course. 3. The best way to preserve green peas, all things considered, is to dry them. 4. Too long to describe here. Will try and let you know if you watch the paper. Ignoramus (Tuggerah).—The fact that smoke ascends straight and high shows that the air is rare and free from aqueous vapor. Probably that is what you mean by lighter. Reader (Manly).—As you say, the limerick craze is dead, and we have no intention of attempting to re suscitate it or cause a new one. Not that your efforts would he likely to do much in that way, since they lack the element of humor, or possess it in such an attenu ated form that it has to be looked for with a magni fying glass. And you have paraphrased one or two which are pretty generally known in an unprintable ver sion. If you seriously imagine this is Wftny there is not much hope for you.

First that the impure; air must be allowed -to escape; andj secondly, that freah air must be admitted.; Impure air in a room is almost always; warm, and will therefore rise towards th'ej ceiling, when it will escape if the window' be opened at the top, while coll fresh air i will enter through the lower part of the f window, if given aohanoe.

Hams may be either boiled or baked. Before either method of cook- ing the ham must be soaked overnight. Cover it with water and let stand till next day. Then scrape off any discoloured fat. To sell or bake a ham allow 20 minutes for every pound, and from 20 to 30 minutes over, according to its size. To boil a ham put it into a large boiler (the copper may be used), cover well with water, and simmer till It is cooked. To bake the ham after It has soaked over- night wipe it dry, then envelop it in a paste made from flour and water, which should be about one inch thick. Pinch all Joins of the paste together securely, then place the ham in a baking dish with one or two cups of water. Put it into a hot oven, gradually reduce oven heat as cook- ing continues, and allow the same time for baking as for boiling. Remove the crust, which should be dark brown in colour when ham is cooked. Remove rind from either baked or boiled ham, and roll in fine browned breadcrumbs. A few cloves may be stuck into it if liked. SMALL CAKES- G.C. (Hay, N.S.W.), and F.R. (Kew).

The processed olives are preferred by most people Care should be taken not to bruise the olives Grade them and place in a solu- tion made up as follows to remove the bitter taste -2oz soda 1oz salt, 1oz lime, 1 gallon water Boil the water and allow it to cool again before mixing this solution and allow it to stand an hour before using The olives must be kept submerged to prevent discolouration When the bitterness has left the fruit pour off the line and cover the olives with water which should be renewed morning and night This washing should be continued so long as the fruit has the peculiar hot taste due to the presence of Ije When the caustic taste has completely left them the olives are ready for pickling Some use brine only at a strength of 2oz of salt to 1 gallon of water. The brine should be replaced by a salt solution containing 4oz of salt to 1 gallon of water Two days later the strength of the solu tion is again increased to 602. of salt to 1 gallon of water; then, two days later, 8oz. to the gallon, two days later again, 10oz. to the gallon, and finally the brine should contain 14oz. of salt to the gallon. Some prefer to process the olives at a temperature of 120deg. Fahr, for 25 minutes, after adding the 8oz. brine, and they should be made airtight at that heat. Cheese Cakes ""Kirtly"" (Malvern) sends the following recipe in answer to the request of ""Pat"" (Ivanhoe). The recipe was given to ""Kirtly"" over 25 years ago by a very old lady, who claimed that it was the original recipe for the renowned Yorkshire cheese cakes: 2 quarts of milk in a can. Stand in a saucepan of water, and let come almost to the boil. Mix 1 pint of butter-milk with 1 teaspoon of powdered alum, and 1 tablespoon of flour, and add to the milk. Bring all to the boil. The whey that forms must be clear; if it is not, add 1 teaspoon of vinegar. Let stand till cold, then strain through muslin. Best cards in a mixing bowl with 2 eggs and a pint of new milk. Add a few currants, nutmeg, and essence of lemon. Put the mixture into this lined with paste, grate nutmeg on top, and put a strip of lemon peel on each. Guava Jam Miss M.H.

Rice, the food which has for years upheld the arm of the Orient. Watch a Chinaman as he cooks his dally meal. He washes the rice in many waters, feeling it dreamily until suddenly it 6eems right: whereat he puts it into his kettle, Which may be only an old peach tin, measures with his middle finger the amount of water standing above the rice, covers it, then sits down beside it to watch it boil. Never does your Oriental make the mistake of using the double boiler or of stirring the rice while it is cooking. ""Rice can't burn. Water shake him too much."" he will respond to your interested questions. When the water has boiled away, the Chinese takes the rice from the fire, and covers it tightly for a minute or twto so that the steam may do its work. THE CHINESE WAY The following recipe is an adapta tion of one of the Chinese or Japan ese methods of cooking rice: Wash one cup of rice is several waters and allow its to stand over night in water. In the morning drain off the water, put the rice into a large kettle and .add to it 2 cupsful of cold water and 1 teaspoon of salt. Be sura the kettle Is large and has a cover. The upper part of the double boiler is good. Let come to a boll. Stir once and keep the fire low enough so that al though the rice boils there is no danger of Doiling oyer. Keep the kettle covered (the steam helps ro cook the rice). The reason for the large kettle is to provide plenty of headroom for the steam. In 20 minutes tbe rice Will be cooked. Remove the cover, place a folded cloth over the top of the kettle, replace the lid and put the kettle Into a pan of boiling water to keep the rice hot until you are ready to serve. The cloth will absorb excess mois ture and steam, rendering the rice very dry, with distinct kerueis. i'et it will be moist, never sticky or hard. a little practise will teach you what size the kettle should be and the proper amount of heat to be used. » RICE CAKES Five yolks of eggs, and 1 white, Jib of castor-sugar, a little ground cinnamon, ioz. of sweet almonds, 4 bitter almonds, lib of ground rice, a large wiueglassful of brandy. Jib of fresh butter. Beat up the eggs, sugar, and cin namon 'Well together; pound in a mortar the sweet and hitter almonds, and while pounding add by degrees the eggs, etc. When sufficiently mixed it should look like thick cream. Add to the mixture the ground rice, brandy, and fresh butter melted. Beat the whole well, pour into but tered patty pans, and bake about a quarter of an hour. SAVORY RICE, CURRIED. Cook rice the Chinese way by steaming it in the top of a double- boiler directly on the stove. To one cup of well-Washed rice, add 2 cups of cold water and a scant teaspoon of salt. Do not remove the cover. Boil gently 10 minutes, or until the steam raises the lid. then place the kettle in the lower part of the boiler and let it cook without removing cover 10 minutes. In the meantime, cook in a hot pan 2 tablespoons of fat with one small onion diced and one table- spoonful of curry powder. When brown, add one cup of stewed toma toes, cook a tew moments and press this through a sieve. When rice is done, add 1 tablespoon of butter, stir with a fork and add 1 beaten egg and the tomato mixture. Turn this into a buttered mould.

The judge (Miss N. J. Cooke) awarded the 5/- prize to Mrs. J. Maloney, of 237 Williams-street, for a Fish Pie with Bechamal Sauce. Second place went te Miss J. Gillespie, of 241 Williams- street, for a recipe for ""Fillets of Whiting and Walnuts."" ""Chinese Stuffed Fish"" was the contribution of Miss E. M. Bennett, 291 Garnet-street, and this was placed third by the judge. Apart from the high standard set by this week's contributors to the competition a feature was the large number of entries received from single women. Their interest is in- creasing each week, and their keen- ness is almost equal to that of housewives. WHAT JUDGE SAID Miss Cooke in making her awards said: The recipes this week were of unusual standard. There were many varied ones with good combinations, showing how fish may be served, varying the dish each time. (From Mrs. J. Maloney 237 Williams-street.)

I In China, cooking is regarded (as an I art not to be learned lightly, and a I Chinese cook spends at least four years I of strict apprenticeship before he can I be regarded as ta cook. The Chinese I are past-masters of the culinary art. I Slap-dash methods or short cuts are not I allowed. Everything is prepared me thodically and great attention is Daid I to detail. In China, cookery books are unknown, the cook must rely upon memory, taste, and smell. Each province, has its special kind of cooking, and each cook has his own special dish. In tlieir cooking the Chinese do not use either bread, cream, milk, butter, cheese, or salt. The place of salt is taken by a sauce made from the soy, or soya beau. The sauce is made by allowing the beans to ferment in % big pot iu the blazing sunlight for two months, during which time a quantity of salt and other seasonings are added. This soy is alleged to be the base of our western Worcester sauce. Boy sauce may be bought iu Australia. The fat used in Chinese cooking is sesame oil; this has a much more de licate flavor than peanut oil. The meats used by the Chinese are pork, duck, and chicken . Beef, as we know it, is not used at 'ail. The Chinese, even of the poorer fam ilies, will spend any amount of time in the preparation of their meals, pounding, mincing, chopping, and shred ding, and it is surprising the variety of dishes a Chinese cook can make from the same ingredients. No Chin ese feast is complete without ancient eggs. These eggs are like wine in that the older they are the better they are in flavor. They are packed in a thick coating of alkaline mud, and allowed to ripen. They are served cut in slices longitudinally. I No one need be afraid of Chinese 1 cooking, for it is perfectly balanced, I and very wholesome. It is customary I to end a Chinese dinner with a bowl I of rice, and it is considered to be very I little short of an insult if the rice is I refused. Bamboo shoots, in all guises, are eaten in China, and they are a most delicious food. Chinese tables are usually rather high, 'and small enough for all the guests to reach the centre of the table conveniently. Noise in eating is con sidered to be polite, the more noise ofie makes the more polite one is. A plate is set at each place, on the right of which is a wine cup, chopsticks, a Chin ese spoon, and a fork with two prongs. The following recipes are 'all worth trying, some of them having been adapted for use by Westerners: — MEAT DUMPLINGS. I (Chu P-ao Pa.) I Make a dough of a cupful and a I half of flour, half egg, and warm water I to mix. Kuead until smooth, and al I low to stand seven or eight minutes I before rolling.

Make into balls, and cover with the dough. Steam for about 30 minutes -over chicken or beef stock, and serve immediately. STUFFED SQUASH. Remove the seeds from 'a squash and fill the cavity with a mixture of a cupful and a half of chopped chicken (beef may be substituted), two table spoonsful Chinese sauce, half cupful minced chestnuts, and a tablespoonful of mushroom's. Place the squash in a double boiler, and steam over half a cupful of water and two tablespoons ful Chinese sauce until well done. PORK CHOPS AND CHINESE SAUCE.

Keep the recipes at hand for your next tennis party or picnic-drinks will remain delectably cool in at 'thermos flask-and remember them, too, when you have a party planned for a su:i.mer evening. But first of all just a tip worth knowing-that really excellent iced drinks can be made with the syrup from any tinned fruit, sharpened with a few drops of lemon juice and diluted with soda water or water, and then left on ice to get thorough ly chilled before serving. Keep that in mind for those impromptu parties or those sudden hot days that find you unlprepared with ""coolers"" and not the energy to take over much trouble making fruit drinks. There is a useful lemon syrup that can be quickly and simply made, too, and kept for a week if stored in corked bottles in a cool place. Simply allow a dozen good-sized lemons to a pound of castor sugar, add the sugar to the lemon juice, stir till dissolved, and bottle. Serve with iced water or iced soda water, with slices of lemon or orange or crystallised cherries as a garnish. And here is a delicious orange ade that is simply and quickly made. To four good-sized oranges you will need to allow the juice of half a lemon and four tablespoons of sugar. Dissolve the sugar in a saucepan, with just enough boiling water to cover it, then add the strained lemon and orange juice and four cups of cold water. Chill and serve with slices of orange and lemon. A delicious squash can be made with loganberry juice, obtained by. crushing the berries and pressing them through a sieve. To one and a half cups of loganberry juice allow a cup of orange juice and! half a cup of lemon juice, half a cup of castor sugar, six very thin slices of cucumber and a quart of soda water. Mix the fruit juice sugar and a teaspoon of grated orange rind together, add the cu cumber slices, unpeeled, and leave to stand on ice for several hours. Mash the cucumber slightly, then strain the drink into a jug and de corate with sprigs of mint. Pineapple teams well with logan berries, too; mix a cup of logan berry juice with half a cup of pine a pple juice and half a cup of sugar, (more if you are using fresh pine). Add the juice of two lemons and leave to stand for an hour. Add crushed ice and a pint of soda water and serve with a sprig of mint on top. Hawaiian punch is pleasantly piquant on a hot day. You will need two cups of orange juice, a quarter of a cup of lemon juice and a cup of grapefruit juice, one and a half cups of icing sugar. Mix the fruit juices and sugar and stir till the sugar is dissolved. Dilute with iced water and serve. And mint lemonade is deliciously refreshing. Boil a cup of sugar and six cups of water together for 20 minutes, then add a cup of mint leaves, bruised, and leave to stand till cool. When cold add the juice of three lemons and serve withi cracked ice and sprigs of mint. Here is a Chinese cooler that is worth trying. Cook for five minutes three-quarters of a cup of sugar, one and a half cups of water, t in shavings of lemon rind, three whole cloves, an inch stick of cinnamon and a tablespoon of chopped soft Canton ginger. Leave to cool, then add a tablespoon of the ginger syrup and the juice of three lemons. Strain, add a cup of water and cracked ice, and serve with mint. This drink by rights should be coloured a light green with colour paste, but it tastes just as good without even if it doesn't look it! And finally a delicious pineapple cup that is made from two cups of grated pineapple, four cups of water, two cups of castor sugar, the juice of three oranges, four lemons and two. cups of tea. Boil the water, sugar and pineapple to gether for a quarter of an hour, add the grated rind and juice of the lemons and the juice of the oranges.: Leave to cool., Strain, add a cup of freshly made tea, then pour into a jug in which some ice has been placed.

THE READER in the picture above is very wise.She keeps all her recipes in a sizable book. When unex- pected guests arrive, or there is a meal to prepare for the family, she has some delightful suggestions at hand. By MARGARET SHEPHERD Instructor to Leading Hospitals. All these recipes have been tested by Miss Shepherd in her own Kitchen. UNUSUAL savory dishes are always a welcome addition to the meal, whether dinner, luncheon, or an informal tea is to be served. Of the many appetising ingredients an enterprising cook can turn to good effect in the savory department, there are, perhaps, no two more tasty than celery and cheese. CELERY is a particularly use- ful item in the kitchen, for it can be used to excellent ad- vantage either hot or cold. The recipes below are chosen as more suitable for July and August, when the cold winds call for dishes hot and savory. CELERY SAVORIES Choose some well-curled celery. Cut into four-inch lengths. Wash well and simmer gently in boiling salted water for 10 minutes, taking care not to have the celery too soft. Lift out; drain. Dry on a clean cloth. When cold, fill with the following mixture: Melt 1 dessertspoon butter in a sauce- pan, add 1 tablespoon flour. Mix. Add 3 tablespoons milk; stir until a thick paste. Then add 4 tablespoons of grated cheese, salt and pepper, paprika, and a little cream. Stir until well mixed. Fill the hollow of each piece of celery. Roll strips of bacon from which the rind has been removed, secure with a toothpick and grill or bake in a flat dish in a hot oven until bacon is cooked and the vege- table hot. CHINESE CHOP SUEY Six pork chops, 1 large onion, 1 stalk of celery, 1 egg, 2 teaspoons bacon fat, 4 cups rice, 2 tablespoons Soy or Worcester sauce. Cut the meat into dice. Melt the fat in a frying-pan. Fry the onion and celery, also the meat, for 5 minutes. Add the beaten egg and stir for a few minutes. Add sauce, and cover. Simmer gently for 5 minutes. Serve on a hot dish with a separate bowl of hot rice cooked as follows: Wash the rice and place in a large saucepan with sufficient water to cover to a depth of 1½ inches; bring to the boil quickly. When it boils up, lower the gas and simmer very slowly for 15 minutes without stirring. CREAM CHEESE SOUP Half a loaf wholemeal bread, 2 cups cream, Gruyere cheese, 2 pints meat stock. See that your meat stock is well- flavored with onion; remove all the fat. Cut the crusts from the bread and then cut in very thin slices. Stack them in a soup tureen or a saucepan, with thin slices of Gruyere in between. Pour over the cream; return the lid and stand in a warm spot until the cream has soaked into the bread. Then add the boiling soup. Serve at once. STEWED PORK AND CABBAGE One and a half pounds lean pork, 2 tablespoons fat (bacon fat pre- ferred), 1½ cups chopped celery, 1 pint water or stock, 6 cups cabbage (shredded), 4 tablespoons minced onion, 1½ teaspoons salt, pepper, and paprika. none Help Melt the fat. Add the pork, cut into small pieces, and brown. Add the onion, celery, and cabbage and brown for 5 minutes. Pour over it the stock. Cover closely and simmer 15 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, paprika to taste. Serve with boiled potatoes. EGGS IN CELERY SAUCE Three hard-boiled eggs, 1½ cups milk, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 table- spoon flour, salt to taste, 1 cup finely chopped celery, ½ onion, blade mace, piece lemon rind, 1 dessertspoon lemon juice, 6 peppercorns, slices of toast spread with anchovy sauce or paste. Put the milk, lemon rind, salt, pep- percorns, onion and mace into a sauce- pan and bring slowly to simmering point. Simmer slowly for 10 minutes. Strain. Melt the butter in a saucepan; add the flour; mix well, then add the strained milk, a little at a time, until well blended. Stir until it boils; add the very finely-chopped celery and simmer slowly for 10 minutes. Add the hard- boiled eggs, which have been shelled and cut into slices. Reheat. Serve on neatly trimmed pieces of toast spread with an- chovy sauce. CELERY SOUFFLE One cup milk, 1 slice onion, 1 cup celery hearts finely chopped, blade mace, small piece lemon rind, 1 des- sertspoon butter, 1 tablespoon flour, 2 tablespoons grated cheese, 3 eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Finely chop the white stalks of celery; put into a saucepan with the onion milk, blade mace, salt, 4 peppercorns, lemon rind, and simmer slowly until tender. Strain the liquid into a basin; at the same time rub the celery through a sieve; add to the liquid. Melt the but- ter in a saucepan; add the flour.

An enormous tulle collar that clips on to yourMress, and is made by cutting, in a circle, three or four layers of tulle, three'times the neck measurement, and box pleating, or closely gathering them, to fit the required neckline. The top frills must be half tlie width of those underneath. To make them stand up well, insert a piece of. millinery wire between the frills, the edges of which should be picoted. ' Of the hundreds of charming ways to wear flowers as accessories, garlands of them round the neck, with a wide bracelet to match, look loveliest. Gardenias on a black frock and scarlet poppies on white, are very smart. When you wear a very plain, untrimmed evening frock, let flowers go to your head. Another way to ring the changes is with a little cape and muff of broderie 'Anglaise, cut on the circular, the extra frills and upstanding collar being sewn on afterwards. A tiny' strip of the latter, gathered to a rosette, makes a flower to conceal tlie press-stud fastening at the throat. The muff can be made any size, from a strip of the material. Before lining it with satin or silk put a piece of wadding between the material. and the lining. Then join the strip and gather up the edges. Muff and cape take about 2 yards of material. RESISTING ""WRINKLES The woman of thirty who glances- at this article, decides that it is specially meant for her, and settles down to study it is of course, perfectly right. But the girl in her twenties who thinks she can wait, to read about wrinkles till she has some of her own, is making a grave mistake. Even if you have no visible wrinkles at the moment you may, unknowingly, be preparing for a positive network of them in a few years time. A skin that is allowed to become dry and undernourished is certain to wrinkle early and badly. Other likely causes of wrinkles iare rash exposure to sun and wind, nerve strain,, eye-strain, headaches, poor circulation, and the use of hard water, harsh soap, and over-strong astringents. The dry, under-nourished skin must be kept supple with plenty of cream. Cleanse with cream at night, wash with tepid , water and superfatted soap, dry carefully and. pat in skin food. In the morning, cleanse with cream again, and wipe off the surplus with tissues. Spray your skin with a mild astringent, fan it dry and than apply cream and powder» Don't be rough with your face when drying it—rubbing the towel round and round pulls the skin into wrinkles. Use the towel gently, stroking outwards and slightly upwards from the centre of tlie face. Strong sunlight encourages wrinkles, both by drying the skin and by making you pucker up your eyes. Sun bathe with caution, especially if you have a delicate, dry skin, or are over thirty. At bedtime, after an outdoor day, oil your face thoroughly and let it stay slightly greasy all night. Motoring is inclined to make frown lines. A wise precaution before starting on a long run is to use a little skin food under your day-cream ami powder, just where the lines come. VARIOUS STAINS Ink Stains: — To remove ink stains from white cottow or linen, lay the stained material over the top of a basin ; and. moisten it with vinegar. Spread half a teaspoonful of. salts of lemon over the stain with the handle of the teaspoon, and leave it for about five minutest Pour a little hot water.thr.ough it slowly, and if necessary repeat the treat- ment. Do not. use salts of lemon 0 silk, wool, or colored materials. On the more delicate materials it U pafest to use a simple remedy like l* juice and baking powder, nmcl on paste and applied to the stain. B ^ the treatment and if a faint mark is Btjn left, shnply wash in the usual W a v Remember that salts of lemon'is posison and must be kept out of the ^J! of children. ' <>' Ironmould Stains: — Use a dessert spoonful of salts of lemon dissolved in J pt. of hot water, and soak the white cotton or linen article until -the stain disappears. - . Mattresses: — To remove ironmould stains from mattress, make a stiff paste of salts of lemon and water and appl'v t 0 the stains. Leave it on them for iq minutes, then wipe off carefully and di-v the mattress by the fire. Mihleiv Stains :—If mildew stains are neglected they will cause the material to rot. Slight -mildew on strong fabrics can be removed by drying, followed by rubbing on a hard surface. On white materials it will be necessary to use a chloride of lime bleach. This is obtained from the ironmonger and the instructions on the packet should carried out carefully. The next day strain and test the strength, then soak the stained articles f for an hour or two wash out the lime when the stains are gone.

MADE FROM ROSES Candied Rose Petals: — These are exceptionally, dainty sweets which can be eaten just, as they are, or used as a decoration for cakes. Pick the petals separately, rinse well in cold water, place on sheets of clean white paper, and put in the sun to dry. Then dip each petal in the white of an egg, dry on sheets of tbin cardboard and sprinkle with castor sugar. Then make your syrup, using 1 lb. sugar and pt. cold water and boil until the sugar threads. Put your rose-petals in shallow pans, pour the syrup over them, and leave them for 24. hours. Spread the petals out once more on cardboard and dry them in a cool oven. Store in airtight jars or bottles until wanted. Rose-Leaf Jam: — In Persia, where coffee, is served almost black, rose-leaf jam is handed round with it—the sweetness of the preserve helping to counteract the bitterness of the strong coffee, The lu'cious confection also found a place in the store-cupboards of our great-greatgrandmothers. Here is the recipe : ' ' Gather a pound of deep-red roseleaves. ' Pour boiling water over them, then strain quickly, and dry. Make a syrup of 1 lb. of granulated sugar and 1 cupful of water.. Add the rose-leaves and simmer gently until the preserve is quite soft and thick. Put into spall pots and keep in a cool place. Rose Frosting: — For every 50 rose- . petals you will need one ""catty"" lbs.) of granulated sugar. Pound your rosepetals into pulp, then add the sugar and stir until the sugar and rose-petals are thoroughly mixed. Then put the mixture to dry in the sun. You will find that, when dried, tue sugar will have retained its granms form and that the confection will be 1 rose-colored and scented. The frosting can then be used either to sweeten ana color drinks, or as a very pretty decoration for iced cakes. Rosed Peaches :. — Here is a recipe for a Chinese delicacy which is worth trying.

FASHIONS. « Holiday Accessories.— Away on holiday we need more evening clo thes than at any other time, and fol lowing are a few tips that may be useful. An enormous tulle collar that clips on to your dress, and is _ .1 _ t. n..Hinn- in a fMl'pJfi. 3 01' 4 hi a. ue uy tm.nj-*&» *« ** ~ ? * layers of tulle, three times the neck measurement, and box pleating, or closely gathering them, to fit the re quired neckline. The toP f'lls must be half the width of those under neath. To make them stand up well insert a piece of millinery wire be tween the frills, the edges of which should be picoted. Of the hundreds of charming ways to wear flowers as accessories, garlands of them round - the neck, with a -wide bracelet to match, look loveliest. Gardenias on a black frock and scarlet poppies on w^hite, are very smart. When you wear a very plain, untrimmed even ing frock, let flowers go to your head. Another way to ring the changes is with a little cape and^muff of broderie Anglaise, .cut on -the circular, the ex tra frills and pustaniug collar being sown on afterwards. A tiny strip of the latter, gathered .to a rosette, makes a flower to conceal the press stud fastening at the throat The muff can be made any size, from a strip of the material. Before lining it with satin or silk' put a piece 'of wadding between the material and the lining. Then join the strip and gather up the edges. Muff and cape take about two yards . of material. * * * ? ... ? BEAUTY. Resisting Wrinkles.— The Avoniau of thirty who glances at this article, decides that it is specially meant Tor her, and settles down to study it is, of course, perfectly right. But the girl in her twenties who thinks she {?an wait till she has some of her own, is making a grave mistake. Even if you have no visible wrinkles at the moment you may, unknowing ly, be preparing for a positive net work of them in a few years time. A skin that is allowed to become ,'dry and under-nourished is certain ? to wrinkle early and badly. Other like ly causes of wrinkles are rash ex ' posure to sun and wind, nerve strain, eye-strain, headaches, poor circula tion, and the use of hard water, harsh soap and over-strong astringents. The dry, under-nourished skin must be kept supple with plenty of cream. Cleanse with cream at night; ' wash with tepid water aiid superfatted soap, dry carefully and pat in skin food. In the morning, cleanse with cream again and _ wipe off .the sur plus with tissues. Spray your skin with a mild astringent, fan it dry and then apply cream and powder. Don't be. rough with your face when drying it— rubbing the towel . round and round . pulls the skin into wrin kles. Use the towel gently, strok ing outwards and slightly upwards from the centre of the face. Strong sunlight encourages wrinkles, both by drying the : skin and by making you pucker' up your eyes. Sun bathe with caution, especially if you .have a delicate, dry skin, or are over 30. At bedtime, after an outdoor day, oil your face thoroughly and let it stay slightly greasy all night. - Motoring is inclined to make frown lines. A wise precaution before starting on. a lemg run is to use a little skin food . under your cday creain and powder, just where the lines come. * * * THE HOME. - ««. . - Various Stains.— Ink , Stains: To - remove ink stains from white cotton . or linen, lay the stained material over the top of a basin and' moisten it with vinegar. Spread half a: tea Bpoonful pf salts of. lemon over the satin with the handle of the. tea spoon, and leave it for about' five min utes. Pour a little hot water through it slowly, and if necessary repeat the treatment. Do not use salts of lemon on silk, wool, or colored mar terials. On the more delicate ma terials it is safest to use a. .simple remedy like lemon juice, and baking powder, made into a paste and ap plied to the stain. Repeat treatment and if'a faint mark is still left, sim ply wash in the usual way. Remem ber that salts_ of lemon is a poison and must be kept out of the way of children. Ironmoukl Stains: Use a desertspoo.nful of salts of lemon dis - 'solved in 1 pint of hot water, and soak the white cot'ton or linen article until the stain disappears. Mat tresses: To remove ironmould stains from a mattress, make a stiff paste of salts of lemon and water and ap ply to the stains. Leave it on them for 10 minutes, then wipe off care fully and dry the mattress by the lire. Mildew Stains: If mildew Stains are neglected they will cause the material to rot. Slight mildew on strong fabrics can be removed by drying, followed by rubbing on a hard surface. On white materials it will be necessary to use a chloride of lime bleach. This is obtained from the ironmonger and the instruc tions on the packet should bo carried out carefully. The next day strain aiid test the strength, then soak the stained articles for an hour or two, Avash out the lime when the stains are gone. Chloride of lime is a strong chemical that must never be used for silk or wool. Oil Stains: A spot of oil will often Come out if it is covered well with powdered magnesia, and left till next day, when it can be ironed carefully. If this fails a non-inflammable spirit should be used. Black motor oil stains can be removed from any material by squeezing it well in a small basin containing a little eucalyptus oil. ? # '? ' * * 'health. Acne.— Time and common sense are needed if you are to cure spots and blackheads. Wash with a medi cated soap and tepid water at least twice a day. Face cloths should be boiled two or three times a week. Use an acne lotion at night. Give up make-up till your skin is better, for fear the rubbing may spread in fection. You can use calamine lo tion in a powder shade instead; it ' will disinfect the blemishes as well as hide them. Blackheads should be steamed over hot water to which you have added Friar's balsam in the | proportion of two teapsoonsful to a jj pint. After ten minutes steaming, bathe the face in the hot liquid and gently press out the blackheads with a. comedo (which you can obtain from any chemist). Spots should be dried up with peroxide of hydrogen, or iodine. A little bicarbonate of soda just moistened with water and dab bed on the spot at night is very ef fective. - Drink plenty of 'water and orange juice; have so much outdoor exercise as possible, and take care to avoid constipation. A. course of yeast' or of milk of magnesia usually helps. Artificial sunlight is valu able in many cases. ' ♦ ..??.. . * COOKING. Made from Roses.— Candied Rose Petals: These are exceptionally dain: J.ye sweets which can be eaten just as they are, or used as a decoration for cakes. Pick the petals scparate lp, rinse well in cold water, place on sheets of clean white paper and put in the sun to dry- Then dip each petal in the white of an -egg, dry on sheets of thin cardboard and sprinkle with castor sugar. Then make your sprup, using lib. of sugar and i pint cold water and boil until the sugar .threads. Put your rose-petals in shallow pans, pour; the syrup over them.and leave them for 24 hours. Spread the petals,- out once on card board and dry them in a cool oven. Store in airtight jars oi-bottles un til wanted. Rose-leaf Jam: In Per sia, where coffee is' served almost black, rose-leaf ,jain' is handed -round with it — the sweetness of the pre serve helping to counteract the .bit terness of the strong coffee. -The lucious confection also found a place in the., store, cupboards of our great great-grandmothers. Here is the recipe: Gather a pound of deep-red rose leaves. Pour boiling water over them, then strain quickly; -arid dry. Make a syrup of lib. of granulated sugar and 1 cupful of water. Add the rose leaves and simmer gently until the preserve is quite soft and thick. Put into small pots and keep in a -cool' place. Rose Frosting: For every 50 rose petals you will need one 'catty' (ljlb.) of granulat ed sugaiv Pound your rose petals into pulp, then add the sugar and stir until the sugar and rose petals are thoroughly mixed. Then put the mixture to dry in the sun. You will find 'that when dried, the sugar will have retained ih granular form and that the confection will be rosecol ored and scented. The frosting can then be used either to sweeten and color drinks or as a very pretty de coration for iced cakes. Rosed Pea ches: Here is a recipe for a Chinese 'delicacy -which is well worth trying. You will need 25 peaches, lib. sugar, I cupful of water, a pint vinegar, i tablespoon of table salt, red roses and cloves. Make a syrup by Jjoiling the sugar, water, vinegar and salt to» gether for 20 minutes. Stand the peaches, in hot water for about three minutes, then rub the down off them with a towel. On the stem part of each peach put a rose. Using the cloves as skewers, fasten the roses to thi* p'eaches. ' Place rosed peaches in the syrup and simmer gently until soft. : GENERAL. ' ? i A Fireside Pouffe: If you haven't a fireside pouffo now is the time to make one. The following is an at tractive pattern and is inexpensive, for the whole of the material can be bought for well under ten shillings. Materials: 21 yards cover fabric, 31 inches wide; lining, 2i yards unr bleached calico, 31 inches wide; 1 yard bias binding; 1 wooden button mould; 1 hank thick piping cord; 1 i LET'S GO GOSSIPING— Coutd. packet shilling; - some rugging and hay. Cut 4 inches off both ends of covering fabric and lining. Join ends of ? lining 'together to form a circle and stitch 1* inch hems at the bottom tightly, tie firmly and tuck ends inside. You will find there is a small hole left in 'the cen tre. Cut a circle of calico and sew over hole. The -lining is now ready to be stuffed. . Put in 'the kapok, .a -handful at a time, and make a flat, even layer all over the bottom of the 'calico case. . Then put in a rugging, a little at a time, spreading it over Ihe kapok in fiat, even layers, until the case is three parts full. Then finish the stuffing- of the case with hay. When you have put in as much stuffing as you can, tie up the case tightly with the second cord, put tho pouffe on the floor and bang it hard' with the back of a brush. v This will force the stuffing together and when you open up the case after tlils' treat ment you will find there is room for a . lot more stuffing. Continue fill ing up and beating until you cannot get another scrap of hay into the cover. Tie the cords up tightly, tuck the ends ? inside and stitch a -circle of unbleached calico over the little hole to keep the stuffing 'from working out. The floor cushion is now ready to be covered. Make the outside fabric cover in exactly the same way that you made the lining, and the same size. ? Now put the pouffe hay side down, inside the cover and pull this'iip over the sufling lin ing. Draw up the second piping cord and lie as tightly as you can. Tuck the ends of the cords inside and cover with a small circle of the ma terial' hemmed on very neatly. To finish the pouffe make a small' ro sette with the material cut on, 'the cross. * # * HINTS. - . Stained Marble. — A piece of lemon, and some common salt rubbed on to the stained marble' of the washstand will leave a glossy,' white surface if left for one hour and then rubbed . off with a solution of soap powder and' water.' , ' . Candlesticks. — Excellent candle sticks can- be made from empty cot-' ton reels and a piece of wood. ' Fix the reels together, running 'a pencil or small stick through the centres of all but the top reel. - Bore a hole in this large enough to hold' a candle. Now get a 3in. square of -wood and glue it to the bottom reel. When the' glue is -hard paint the whole in some bright colored' enamel.

' MADE FROM . ROSES— Candied Rose Petals: These are exceptionally ’dainty sw'eets which can be eaten just as they are, or used as a decoration tor cakes. Pick the petals separate ly, rinse well in cold water, place on 'sheets of clean white paper, and put in the sun to dry. Then dip each petal in the white of an egg dry on sheets of thin cardboard and sprinkle with castor sugar. Then make your syrup, using 1 lb. sugar and i pint ’ cold water and boll until the sugar threads. Put your rose petals in shal low pans, pour the syrup over them, and leave them for 24 hours. Spread ■ the petals out once more on oard ' board and dry them in a cool oven. Store in airtight jars or bottles until wanted. ' Rose Leaf Jam: In Persia, where • coffee is served almost black, rose leaf jam is handed round with it— the sweetness of the preserve helping 'to' counteract the bitterness of the strong coffee. The luscious confection’ also found a place in the store cupboards of our great-great-grand mothers, Here is the recipe: Gather a pound of deep-red rose-leaves. Pour boiling water over them, then strain quickly, and dry. Make, a syrup of 1 lb. o£ granulated fsugar ami 1 cup fill of water. Add the rose-leaves and simmer gqntly until'f tlie preserve la quite soft and thicljf. Put into small pots and keep in a«cool place. —J* ' 0 Hose Frosting: For every CO rose petals you will nee(i one ""catty” (H lbs.) of granulateil sugar. Pound your rose-petals into pulp, then mid the sugar and stir until the sugar and rose-petals are thoroughly mixed. Then put the mixture to! dry in the suit. 'You will find that! when dried, ’be sugar will have retained Its granular form and that the confection wil !be rose-coloured and scented. The frost ing can then be used either to sweeten and colour drinks, or as a very pretty decoration for iced cakes. Rosed Poaches: Here is a recipe tor a Chinese delicacy which is well worth trying. You' will need 25 peaches, 1 lb. sugar. 5 cupful of water, 5 pint vinegar, ? S tablespoonful of table salt, red roses and cloves.

A FIRESIDE POUFFE. —lf you haven’t a fireside pouffe now is the time to make one. The following is an attractive pattern and is inexpen sive, for the whole of the material can be bought for well under ten shillings. Materials: 2J yards cover fabric, 31 ins. wide; lining, 2J yds. un bleached calico, 31 ins. wide; 1 yd. bias binding: 1 wooden button mould; [1 hank thick piping-cord; 1 packet ruiSehTg-and-hay. j Cut ‘1 ins. off both ends of covering I fabric and lining. Join ends of lin ■ ing together to form a circle and | stitch 11 ins. hems at the top and bot tom. Thread these hems with piping i cortl - Draw up the bottom tightly, tie i firmly and tuck ends inside. You will find there is a small hole left in the centre. Cut a circle of calico and sew over hole. The lining is now ready to be stuffed. Put in the kapok, hand ful at a time, and make a fiat, even layer all over the bottom of the calico case. Then put in the rugging, a little at a time, spreading it over the kapok in flat, even layers, until the case is three-parts full.- Then finish the stuffing of the case with hay. When you have put in as much stuffing as you can tie'up the ease tightly with the second cord, put the pouffe on the floor and bang it hard with the back of a brush. Tills will force the stuf fing together and when you. open up the case after this treatment you will I find there is room for a lot more stuf fing. Continue filling up and beating until you cannot got another scrap of hay into the cover. ‘ Tie the cords UP tightly, tuck tlie ends inside and 'stitch a circle of unbleached calico over the little hole to keep the stuf fing from working out. The floor cushion is now ready to be covered. Make the outside fabric cover in ex ' actly the same way that you made the . lining, and the same size. Now put the pouffe hay side down, inside the cover and pull this up over the stuf fing lining. Draw up the second pip ing cord and tie as tightly as you can. Tuck the ends of the cords inside and • cover with a small circle of the material hemmed on very neatly. To , finish the pouffe make a small rosette with the material cut on the crons. I HINTS. STAINED MARBLE. —A piece of lemon anil, some common salt, nib bed on to the. stained marble of the washstand will leave a glossy, white surface if left for one hour and then rubbed oft with a solution of soap powder and water. CANDLESTICKS. Excellent candlesticks can be made from eippty cotton reels and a piece of wood. Fix the reels together, the smallest at the top, the biggest at the bottom. Glue them together, running a pencil or small stick through the centres of all but the top reel. Bore a hole in this lare enough to hold a candle. Nov got a 3-ln. square of wood and glue It to the bottom reel. When' the glue 'ls hard, paint the’whole in some Bright coloured enamel. SCENT SPRAYS.

This will not hap pen if only the white of the egg is used. Never keep coffee in a tin. Empty it into a glass jar as soon as possible, and it will keep its flavor longer. ? ? ? Potatoes will cook more quickly if they are left to stand in hot water for about a quarter of an hour before being baked in the oven. ? ? ? Before boiling milk, put a little water in the bottom of the pan to prevent the milk sticking to the pan. When boiling onions the best way to ensure them keeping whole is to pack them in a. wire frying pan and place this in the pan of boiling water. When they are tender they can be drained in the basket and then dished. Stewed nreat should always be al lowed to simmer, but never boil, or it will be tough. ? ? * Tea is improved in flavor if a small piece of dried orange vind is kept in the caddy. ? ? ? When making custard, mix the beaten eggs with milk that is slightly warm, and the custard will not turn watery. ? ? ? Jam is apt to beeom'e hard and ?sugary in cold weather. Place the jars in the oven — which should be only slightly heated — for a few min utes once or twice a week. This will keep the jam in good condition. Eggs should never be friend in shal low fat; it makes the white tough and indigestible. ? ? ? Dumplings should always be boiled in a saucepan with the lid slightly raised. If cooked in this fashion they will not be heavy. The water must boil all the time. ? ? ? If lemons are allowed to remain in a moderate oven for a few minutes the extraction of the juice will be greatly facilitated. Lemons are so good for us that they should be used whenever possible in cookery. ? ? ? Eoast orange is delicious. Cut oft a third of an orange, prick the in side with a fork without piercing the skin, fill up with fine sugar, replace the cap and place in the oven as you would an apple. ? ? ? Kidneys fried the following way, will retain all their flavor and look and taste appetising. Fry briskly for 15 minutes in some butter. Then remove from the frying pan. , Stir a little flour into the gravy in the pan, when brown add a little water. Serve this over the kidneys with rings of lightly friend- tomatoes. ? ?

A small onion or a shave or a leek would naturally be a distinct improvement, though not really essential. First cut up the meat into small cubes or dice, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. While the meat is absorbing the seasoning cut up the vegetables also into small pieces. Whatever amount of onions or leeks that can be spared should also be cut up and fried with a little cooking fat, margarine, or dripping. -Now add the meat, and fry until well browned all over. Add the vegetables a little at a time (root vegetables are always added before green vegetables, since they take longer to cook). When all the vegetables are in the saucepan put the lid on and leave them to cook in their, own juices for a short while. In the meantime make a gravy mixture by mixing a tablespoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, pepper to taste, and a half a teaspoonful of sugar if you can spare it-and 2 tablespoonfuls cold water. Stir the contents in the saucepan, and when the ingredients seem well shrunken I in amount add the gravy mixture. ] A few drops of Worcester sauce would be an improvement to the gravy, and would take the place of the Soya bean sauce, so much used in China.

Since ""me ac- cident"" this particular shoul- der has had its fair share of baking and should be done to a turn by now. It has had X ray, short wave, infra-red ray, and electric treatment of all sorts, and I should imagine that I am now charged to such a state that I am probably radio active. In answer to all thoae of you Who wanted to know what ac- tually happened, here is the "" simple little story. Two cars met a little too closely and a . great deal too violently. Re- sult, a shoulder that felt as if the'League premiers had mis- taken it for the football that made the winning goal. That, plus shock, took my mind com- pletely off cooking. As a matter of fact, it took my mind com- pletely off everything for the .time being. When asked by the police for my name at the scene of the accident I couldn't tell them. I was walking about, I thought, quite intelligent and all there, and rather ashamed really that my name had slipped me for the moment. Other victims at the scene told me that 1 said to the cops: ""It's on the tip of my tongue. I know it as well as I know my own,"" and this bit of airy per- siflage had them calling for the doctor in firm round tones. Thanks for all your letters on the subject. If my answers to ^you have lagged a bit, you will understand that my mind has not been on the job. But here it is back again on the grand old game of cooking, and this week the subject is the trim- mings. I don't say that I would rather have a badly cooked meal well served than a good meal slapped up any old way, but I do say that trimmings add that extra bit of eye appeal to a good meal that make them well worth the trouble. Cutlets with a frilly collar taste better to me than cut- lets just slammed on a plate with a couple of ""vegs."" A baked tomato topped with a sprig of parsley sitting along- side some saratoga chips and a neatly crisp bacon roll look and taste better than when the tomato is just a floppy mush and the bacon a limp slab. , These are just small illustra- tions, but eye appeal goes further than that. This week's competition, then, is for recipes for those little bits and pieces that accompany a main course and take it from the ordinary to the particular. The special sauce or jelly you serve with an ordinary dish. The special salad you build up. to accom- pany the cold meat for Sunday supper, that little individual touch you have worked up for this or that dish which makes eaters' eyes light up when they meet it. If you have a special conceit, a fancy notion that has gone down well in the past, send it in and we will see if we like it.

For those of us who can't spend hours over a hot stove but who like home- made jam this should be a help. It tornes from Mrs D. S. Hamilton, of 187 Melville rd, Pascoevale South. LEMON JAM Ingredients: Lemons. Water. Sugar. Method: Halve as many lemons as you wish and squeeze the juice out. Mince the rinds finely. Measure the juice and minced rinds and add three times the quantity of. water. Leave overnight, and next day cook gently for half an hour. Then add an equal quantity of sugar and boil quickly until it jells. Simple, isn't it? From Fiji comes this recipe in answer to our competition for' pies. The writer modestly wants her name kept out, but it was so exciting getting a recipe from Fiji that here it is: MEAT PIE Ingredients: lib topside steak. ¡ ' Small onions. Herbs. Salt, pepper. One cup water. ^ For the pastry 2 cups of flour. Salt. One cup butter-fat or whatever one can get. Method: i Mince meat and seasoning with a coarse cutter, add water, mix well, an'* let stand for as long as pos- sible. Roll pastry out thinly and line ft plate or dish. Put meat in cover with pastry, pressing edges well together, make a hole in the top, brush over with milk. Bake for at least an hour in a hot oven at first, finishing with a medium one. The great secret is not to cook the meat first. Several eggs broken in and cooked with the meat add greatly to this pie, but at 4/6 a dozen, as they are up here, this is a luxury which cannot be in- dulged. The correspondent adds: ""The mails are sometimes long in arriving, which accounts for my late entry."" From Mrs T. Geoghegan, of 47 Milan st, Mentone, corries a spring weather salad. It is called ""Ameri- can Spring Salad."" Ingredients: 2 cups of finely chopped cabbage (inside leaves). Half cup of chopped parsley. 2 small white onions. Pepper. Salt. Method: Slice the onions finely and toss the salad, serve with this dressing For the salad: «Tssing. 3 tablespoonsful vinegar. 3 tablespoonsful sugar Mix sugar method: Mix sugar and vinegar well tn gether until dissolved, then vZ over the cabbage, parsley, and onions, and mix well.

To Üús mixture add alternately the sifted dry ingredients and the hot water. Fold in the raisins and lemon rind pour into well-greased 8in rta» mould, and bake in a moderate oven (350deg F) for 30 minutes or a little longer. Turn on to a rack to cool. When cool, fill centre with either stewed or tinned fruit, snd, as whipped cream is not available, a good custard must suffice. This is nice chilled for hot days in the summer time. Mrs. O. Thompson, of Moonta, South Australia, recommends these for your next party: ""CHINESE CHEW' Ingredients: } cup of flour. _ teaspoonful of baking powder. _ teaspoonful of salt. 2 eggs. i cup of sugar. 1 cup of chopped dates. 1 cup of chopped nuts. _ teaspoonful vanilla.

When cool enough to handle, remove the crisp edges, cut the remainder into squares, roll into balls, and dip in the castor sugar. And here are two requests from readers for recipes. Can you help? Mrs Balfour, of Briggs st, Caul- field, wants to know if any reader could supply the recipe of a cake called ""Cherry Log."" It has a choco- late cake centre, about 2in in diame- ter, and is covered in a cream mix- ture rather after the style of choco- late ripple cake. Mrs C. B. Davie, of Hilltop rd, Ferntree Gully, writes: ""Can any reader give me a recipe for Fruit Marshmallow? I know there are two oranges, a lemon, gelatine, passionfruit, sugar, and plain flour, but in what proportions and what method I know not."" This is a very nice sweet when made and does not need cream.

Almost every housewife has gone to school again in order, to ensure to her family a well-balanced diet on severely rationed commodities. Vegetables-, that had long been superseded by? more de licate varieties have returned' to favor, and are taking part in combating ills caused by. too many over-refined foods of modern times. Even common weeds are providing vitamins at no cost, as well as health ful excursions in search of ' them. Old herbals are being searched fpr. the re cipes of our great-grahdniothers; who Had never: heard the word vitamin, yet were providing their families with the necessary quota. Australian green grocers appear to regard; 'cabbage, spinach- and - silver, beet as the . only greens worthy of the; cook's .'skill'."". In a few shops it is possible to buy bunches of buccoli shoots, but the rest' is silence. In English shops and mar kets there may be, bought, tied sepa- '. rately or, in mixed bunches, tender i tops of sugar, red and silver -beets, "" turnip and . swede tops, the ?' tips; and ' side shoots of broccoli, Chinese [mus tard, Chinese cabbage,, sea kale and the tender shoots of various cabbages; They are cooked separately, or mixed, ; "" in very little . water, or, better still, i steamed. A mixed .bunch may also contain watercress, a few sprigs of parsley and others ""greens"" in sea- ; son. . ... . Finesf in the World The two nrost valuable greens In these mixed: bunches are : turnip tops < and watercress, Turnip tops have been freely used in England since their introduction nearly 400 years ago. Some .English people who have eaten' these tops in Australia say that they are not well grown here. According to jEsop, the earth is a harsh? step mother to those plants which are in corporated into her soil, . but she is a ; loving mother to those .which are her ,y own free production. : Despite ASsop's edlct,< most vege- -. tables that grow in Europe will do well, often better, in sunny Australia. - Try them grown in well-matured com post. To-day, turnip greens are known as a valuable anti-scorbutic— an' excellent source of vitamin A (which controls growth), a very good source of C, iron and calcium, and 'also a source of B and phosphate. So our grandmothers were ahead of their times. We are? all ? so familiar with the word vitamin that we hardly rea lise how modern it really is. Richard / Jeff eries had never heard it, yet, writ ing 57 years ago, he described the im portance of vitamin-rich foods. In ""Amaryllis, at the Fair,"" iden, a . fine old Wiltshire farmer, finds it dif ficult to adapt himself to modem ways. He loved the old; crafts and the old foods; grass-fed meat cooked at a wood fire, not over coal or in an oven. His potatoes must be equal to the finest bread- — ""the: gravy must go up into them like tea Into a nob of sugar."" With roast mutton he must have swede greens, ""the- top of all physic. . . .,T if you can get swede greens fresh you don't need a doctor within twenty miles. There's nothing in- all the chemists' shops ""to equal them, but they must be eaten in the , spring, when full of sap."" It's tills sap which Is so good for the blood.

"".'It 'lsioiie -of the'jVthingS Which defy analysis. /There is some- thing beyond What 'the laboratory can lay bands on— something that cannot be weighed, or seen or estimated by quantity. It is significant that' to-day swede greens are acknowledged as an excellent source, of vitamin A, and a rich source of C, calcium and iron. The root is grated and squeezed for its juice, which is a substitute for orange and other fruit juices. Wise Ancient Greeks The value of watercress, alone or mixed with other greens, must, not be under-estimated. It .is even richer than turnip greens in vitamin C, and equals it in A, iron and calcium. The lavish use- made of watercress by the ancient Greeks has been more than -Justified by modern science. It should bo in every garden, cither to mix with conventional vegetables, for a pottage, for soup, or as a green sauce to serve with root vegetables. The savory mess of watercress in Herrick's grace-before-meat was a pottage. Watercress was at one time cried in the streets of London, chiefly by . women, who gathered it from streams and ponds on the outskirts of the city. Dr. King Chambers ascribed the ill-health of city people to their inability to obtain fresh vege tables. He said: — ""I regard the water cress seller as one of the saviors of her country."" ...Writing 165 years ago, Gilbert White comments on the increased use of vegetables, and is inclined to give the /green , stalls of cities most of the credit for the Improved health of English people of all classes. He even goes as far as to suggest that the de cline in the terrible Incidence of lep rosy in Europe was due to the pro fusion of fruits, legumes and. greens avallaole. During the time . of the leprosy scourge, there was no provision for growing winter food for animals, no sown grasses, field; turnips; swedes, &c.,.nor hay. Cattle which had fat tened in summer must be killed or allowed to starve through the winter months. Consequently there was nothing but salted meat for winter and spring.. This diet, without green vegetables,, was the' cause of much ill-health; Holinshed (1580) tells us that vegetables had: been neglected for about 100 years; from the time of Henry IV. to the beginning of Henry VTII.'s reign; they were either -un known, or. were regarded as food for hogs and savage beasts . rather than for mankind. It must be remembered that gardening was always at a low ebb in: England when wars were being fought on her own soil. Use More Greens Dandelion leaves, .-'stripped' from their ; mid-ribs, purslane, and even curled cress, and the .small mustard which is convention ally served ; with it, : : are often added to tlie mixed greens. The hum ble dandelion, taken from Russia by bomber to the U.S.A. for . its , great Eossibilitles in the production of rub er, has already found favor as vege-; table and salad. The tender spring tips of lucerne, gathered just before flowering, are added to mixed greens. They contain vitamins A and C, as well as iron and calcium. Lucerne also- contains another important,, but less well-known vitamin. K, which has some effect upon hemorrhage. The Chinese grow a special species for food, the tender young shoots being preserved for winter use. People of conservative tastes, who do not care for mountain spinach, lambs's let tuce, good King Henry or purslane,, should try them steamed with spinach or silver beet. There is no more useful green for our Australian climate than the broad-leafed French sorrel (Oscille) . Although at ""--their best in spring, luscious leaves may be had through out the year. Remove the midribs, cook in water for three minutes, strain, return to the pan, and cream in a tablespoon of rich milk,: a nut of butter, teaspoon of flour, pepper and salt. Sorrel soup and sorrel pot tage,, with milk and cream, are cool ing for . summer use. Add nothing to the , soup except half a cup . of finely chopped watercress, or Chinese -mus tard, just before serving. Sorrel- tart, flavored with- angelica, should be popular here.: Being made with green leaves/ it is superior to . rhubarb. Housewives in Australia are turning their attention, to some of these sub stitutes to eke out the- conventional vegetables now so highly pi-iced.. With a butter ration still renerous compared ;with that of English-people, we? have little.- need -of. artificially vitamlnised foods as long as we keep up the sup ply. of vegetables. We have one of the lowest death rates in the world, due, shall we say, to our . sunny climate, to the long yearly period during which an abun dance . of greens may ue grown, and to our naturally vitaminlsed foods. In Bulgaria, where, according to Dr. Paul -Kolochov, the longest-lived people are found, great quantities of capsicums are eaten. Green capsicums are rich in vitamin C. They grow readily In Australia. With so many vitamin-rich greens available, there should be no need of synthesised vita mins in Australia.",green good health wartime vitamin ec fine health english people cir c u m s t nce ex p ecte lower vitality largely woman housewife go school order ensure family wellbalanced diet severely ration commodity vegetable long supersede de licate variety return favor take combat ill cause overrefine food modern time common weed provide vitamin cost health ful excursion search   old herbal search fpr cipe greatgrahdniother hear word vitamin provide family necessary quota australian green grocer appear regard cabbage spinach   silver beet   green worthy cook skill shop possible buy bunche buccoli shoot rest silence english shop mar ket buy tie sepa   rately mixed bunche tender tops sugar red silver beet   turnip   swede top   tip   shoot broccoli chinese mus tard chinese cabbage sea kale tender shoot cabbage cook separately mix    little   water well steam mixed bunch contain watercress sprig parsley green sea   son     finesf world nrost valuable green mixed bunche   turnip top   watercress turnip top freely england introduction nearly 400 year ago english people eat top australia grow accord jesop earth harsh step mother plant corporated soil     love mother y free production   despite assop edlct vege   table grow europe well sunny australia   try grow wellmature com post today turnip green know valuable antiscorbutic excellent source vitamin control growth good source c iron calcium source b phosphate grandmother ahead time   familiar word vitamin hardly rea lise modern richard   jeff erie hear writ ing 57 year ago describe m portance vitaminrich food amaryllis fair iden   fine old wiltshire farmer find dif ficult adapt modem way love old craft old food grassfe meat cook wood fire coal oven potato equal fine bread   gravy like tea nob sugar roast mutton swede green physic    t swede green fresh not need doctor mile s chemist shop equal eat   spring sap till sap good blood vegetable rnore woody fibre sap good    blood tellyou   know lsioiie thejvthing defy analysis thing laboratory lay band weigh see estimate quantity significant today swede green acknowledge excellent source vitamin rich source c calcium iron root grated squeeze juice substitute orange fruit juice wise ancient greek value watercress mix green underestimate rich turnip green vitamin c equal iron calcium lavish use watercress ancient greek justify modern science bo garden cither mix conventional vegetable pottage soup green sauce serve root vegetable savory mess watercress herrick gracebeforemeat pottage watercress time cry street london chiefly   woman gather stream pond outskirt city dr king chamber ascribe illhealth city people inability obtain fresh vege table say   regard water cress seller savior country write 165 year ago gilbert white comment increase use vegetable inclined green   stall city credit improved health english people class go far suggest de cline terrible incidence lep rosy europe pro fusion fruit legume green avallaole time   leprosy scourge provision grow winter food animal sown grass field turnip swede cnor hay cattle fat tene summer kill allow starve winter month consequently salt meat winter spring diet green vegetable cause illhealth holinshe 1580 tell vegetable neglect 100 year time henry iv beginning henry vtiis reign un know regard food hog savage beast   mankind remember gardening low ebb england war fight soil use green dandelion leave strip   midribs purslane curl cress small mustard convention ally serve      add tlie mixed green hum ble dandelion take russia bomber usa     great eossibilitle production rub er find favor vege table salad tender spring tip lucerne gather flowering add mixed green contain vitamin c iron calcium lucerne contain important wellknown vitamin k effect hemorrhage chinese grow special specie food tender young shoot preserve winter use people conservative taste care mountain spinach lambss let tuce good king henry purslane try steam spinach silver beet useful green australian climate broadleafe french sorrel oscille   good spring luscious leave year remove midribs cook water minute strain return pan cream tablespoon rich milk nut butter teaspoon flour pepper salt sorrel soup sorrel pot tage milk cream cool ing   summer use add   soup half cup   finely chop watercress chinese mus tard serve sorrel tart flavor angelica popular green leave superior   rhubarb housewife australia turn attention sub stitute eke conventional vegetable highly piice butter ration renerous compare englishpeople little need artificially vitamlnise food long sup ply vegetable low death rate world shall   sunny climate long yearly period abun dance   green ue grown naturally vitaminlse food bulgaria accord dr paul kolochov longestlived people find great quantity capsicum eat green capsicum rich vitamin c grow readily australia vitaminrich green available need synthesised vita min australia,1943,sorrel soup
